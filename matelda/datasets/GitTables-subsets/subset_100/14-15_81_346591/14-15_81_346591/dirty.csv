I think the far more interesting questions are why we do irrational things in the face of clear and overwhelming evidence. For instance, the knowledge of how to become physically fit and wealthy is public knowledge and freely available to anyone with internet access. I know I shouldn&#x27;t eat that giant piece of cake right before I go to bed, but I do anyway, every night. I think the answer is, we are ruled by our chemical makeup, much more than any of us care to admit. The research discussed in &quot;The Power of Habit&quot; is the most interesting as far as ways to overcome our dependence on chemical/hormonal states ruling our lives.",1419778712

It says that students who were praised for &quot;being smart&quot; developed this ego/defensiveness problem and subsequently began to underperform. While students praised for working hard did not, and ended up outperforming the &quot;smart&quot; group. The amazing thing about the research, to me, is that this effect was very prominent and quick, and it happened based on only one sentence being told to the students on one occasion. It did not take years of parents telling their child, &quot;you are so smart&quot;. It took one teacher telling the child once, &quot;you did so well, you must have worked hard&quot;, for the effect to take place.<p>[1] <a href=""http://nymag.com/news/features/27840/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nymag.com/news/features/27840/</a>",1419778115

I’m currently experimenting with a vertical mouse (Anchor), a handheld trackball (IMAGE), a handheld touchpad (Perixx), a vertical keyboard (Kinesis Freestyle2), an ergonomic keyboard (Kinesis Advantage), a sitting/standing desk (IKEA) and a sitting ball. The most effective changes seem to be the vertical keyboard, the remote trackball, the new desk and a couple of streching exercises I started doing. While the Advantage does relieve the pinkies in Emacs, it still feels inferior to the vertical Freestyle2 because the forearms are still in a twisted pose.

It&#x27;s an IaaS deployment / management / update tool which has been used in production for several years.<p>You create two yaml files: a release manifest (describing the software components of your system) and a deployment manifest (describing the computers and networks of your system and how to map components to them).<p>This separation means that a single release manifest can be applied to many different actual deployments. At my day job I deploy a large PaaS release into a single virtual machine. My colleagues deploy exactly the same release into AWS with thousands of machines.<p>Systems defined using BOSH can be deployed to AWS, vSphere, OpenStack or Warden (a containerisation system).<p>For local development, the Warden backend enables &quot;BOSH lite&quot;[2] -- releasing and deploying into a virtual machine that hosts a local cloud of containers.<p>If you want to go the next level up to a proper PaaS, you can try Cloud Foundry[3]. It&#x27;s defined as a BOSH release[4], which is how at my day job my co-workers and I are able to work both locally and at scale on identical software.<p>In Cloud Foundry we distinguish between stateless (apps) and stateful (services) software, and we provide a simple way to connect them. The easiest way to play with it is to log into Pivotal Web Services. IBM Bluemix is the same software and is also open to the public.<p>So for example, with Cloud Foundry, if you want ten copies of your app, you do this:<p><pre><code>    $ cf scale my_app -i 10\n</code></pre>\nAnd it&#x27;ll be scaled up to 10 instances.<p>Need more RAM?<p><pre><code>    $ cf scale my_app -m 2G\n</code></pre>\nNow each node gets 2Gb.<p>And so on.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-lite"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-lite</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release</a>",1419776136
