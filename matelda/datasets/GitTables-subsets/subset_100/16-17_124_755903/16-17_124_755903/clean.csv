They are expensive to live in and full of tempting and expensive distractions.   If you're serious about bootstrapping a web startup and can choose where you live,  then living in an unglamorous place with a great net connection is one of the easiest ways to stretch the time you have before funds run out.",1247936331

The best luck I've had is with prior knowledge of the person (worked with them in the past, knew them from an Open Source project, etc.).  I'm suspicious of the network hiring process, though, as it seems to narrow the pool too much, and certainly doesn't scale.  I think it can also bring about quality degradation over time as people bring in people they <i>like</i> rather than people that are the best.<p>I just have a sneaking suspicion that some of the things that Google does wrong could possibly be attributed to hiring predominantly from the ""teacher's pet"" archetype.",1247935915

This will give you access to some jobs that require credentials, and it will give you a deeper understanding of the field, but if you don't enjoy school, you can (with some dedication) get similar experience on the job. In any case, book learning alone won't be enough.

711889,comment,711707,711707,0,0,old-gregg,,,"The piece is written completely in reverse, spreading popular myths as opposed to debunking them. Actually it <i>does</i> take a lot of money to start a new business. True, an ""average startup"" probably ""gets going"" on 25K or less, but you don't want to head where average startups usually go (oblivion).<p>And just for the record, 25K is about 3 months of modest living for a team of 3 in SF/NYC/Boston. Then you should start generating ~20K/month of revenue to support yourself. \nZero to 20K in 3 months? Good luck with that.<p>An ""average"" <i>successful</i> startup goes through several rounds of funding, just look at some recent exits and see how many of them took 25K or less.<p>About bank financing: the ""myth"" is true. You won't use it. Banks always tie their loans to either solid revenue history or personal obligations of the founders. It won't be any different from taking a home equity, don't do it.<p>Tech startups aren't restaurants: they have zero revenue for the first 1..3 years. That's why looking at federal reserve stats for small businesses is pointless. Getting a loan to run a roofing business isn't the same as getting a loan to sit and code for a year.",1247935300
711888,comment,711709,711728,0,0,webwright,,,"Totally agree.  Many of the most impressive people I've met were fuckups in HS, which pretty much blocks you from a great college.  Google is basically selecting for people who either grew up really fast or had parents bully them into academic performance.  Of course, they are also selecting for people who have a great work ethic, aren't stupid, and largely play by the rules.<p>Out of curiosity, how would you thin the applicant herd?  Say you have 10,000 resumes sitting on your desk for a CS job.  You can't read them all so you need to set a few automatable/arbitrary rules to get the pile down to 50 or so.  What rules do you use?  Years of experience? Google HR can't take the time to get to know 10,000 people.<p>What Google does is incredibly imperfect, but to trim their resume flow down to a smaller number they haven't made a terrible choice.

711870,comment,710912,710917,0,0,steveklabnik,,,"I know this question wasn't directed at me, but as another small OS developer, I'll give you an additional perspective.<p>I'm developing a kernel (and later an OS around it) called XOmB. It's an exokernel design.<p>Originally, we started our project as a reason to learn the D language. We were tossing around project ideas, and someone brought up an OS. We started bouncing around some ideas, and we decided that this could actually be a pretty cool project. In addition, the systems space is interesting, because you hear less about it. A lot of people are interested in web apps, or desktop apps, but not nearly as many people are interested in systems. Most of the time, this is due to a supposition that systems are 'too hard for me.' We wanted to help educate others, and try to get more people interested in systems programming.<p>As far as uniqueness goes, first of all, there hasn't been a real exokernel written yet. The original paper had a small one with it, but it was mostly just for the paper, nothing huge. We're also writing a lot of documentation, and trying to aim it at a beginner. We started a spin-off project named XOmB Bare Bones that does all of the lowest-level work for someone who would want to write an OS in D, letting them jump straight to kmain. About 35 pages of documents were written on this process, with code citations and such... we hope to have our full kernel documented in this way.",1247933963

For me that number is zero. iirc all of my python dependencies are libraries. And if I stumbled into something that comes with a binary, with a broken hashbang line, then I'd be rather motivated to not only fix it, but to also feed the fix upstream. If the project is useful enough for me to use it then those 10 minutes of my time for a brown-paper-bag micropatch are a no-brainer.<p>Well, to each their own. - But I still think this is a solution looking for a problem, with the potential to create more problems than it solves.",1247933933
