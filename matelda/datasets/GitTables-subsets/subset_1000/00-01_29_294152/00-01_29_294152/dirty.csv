50270,comment,50219,50268,0,0,rms,,,"When online piracy reaches a certain point of perfection, there is no reason to buy music anymore.<p>I'm a member of oink, which is one of the best private bittorrent trackers out there. It is focused mainly on music. It's both where I acquire music and discover music. Everyday, I go and I look at the Top 50 most popular albums uploaded today and at least three or four sound interesting. I usually download at one MB/s and the oink archives are by far more complete than iTunes. I also get to pick from a FLAC and V0 encoding, at least. By the time I've discovered my new music, I already have the whole album. Thank you, technology.",1188953221

50268,comment,50219,50219,0,0,cstejerean,,,"interesting article, but i'm not sure if I agree. <p>I think iTunes reduces a lot of the risk the article is revolving around (of buying something you didn't like in the first place). I think most P2P downloads are of songs one heard on the radio. If I wanted to discover new music I'd go for Pandora or last.fm instead of illegal downloads.<p>I can say from personal experience that when I was a student and was low on cash I felt bad about spending 20 dollars at a time on an album (out of which I liked a couple of songs). Buying songs from iTunes allowed me to buy what I wanted or get entire albums for $10 dollars. But even that didn't allow me to get all the music I wanted on a student budget.<p>Now that I have a job I ended up spending hundreds of dollars on iTunes over time because for the most part it was less time consuming than finding the music on P2P networks. Once my time became valuable buying music started to make sense. ",1188952146

But how much more spookier is it than Google (or for that matter any other search engine) keeping track of what you search for?

50263,comment,50243,50243,0,0,cstejerean,,,"""To a manager, the important insight is the very small amount required to achieve a significant result."" <p>I don't think I remember the last time my manager was impressed with how few lines of code solving a problem required. I think managers care more about how quickly a problem is solved, how well the solution works and how easy the code is to maintain.<p>""If other data manipulation is similarly simple, why should development require such large resources?""<p>I'm not sure if saving on typing by using few symbols will reduce the amount of time required to build non-trivial applications. The limiting factor most of the time seems to be how fast one can think (and how many tries it takes to get something right). Programming languages can help this by allowing one to think at higher levels of abstractions.<p>Another problem with developing non-trivial applications is the amount of time required for new people to get up to speed and understand the code base.<p>While J might be a better language that C for data processing, I can think of many languages far better than C, Basic or Java for the task (like Python). I'd be curious how the article might have been written if it attempted to compare J with Python.",1188951649
