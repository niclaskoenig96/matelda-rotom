It's like a bankrupt railroad being allowed to use their competitor's track free of charge, simply by virtue of the fact that they have gone bankrupt and therefore should be afforded some sort of perversely 'level' playing field on which to compete.<p>I similarly think the antitrust case against Microsoft was dubious. As a web developer like many of you, I certainly scorned them for the anguish they caused me by bundling IE with Windows and thus shoe-horning it into the position of dominant browser. But I can't say I feel they shouldn't have been allowed to do that, even if it gave them an 'unfair' advantage over Netscape.

750069,comment,749931,749931,0,0,apsurd,,,"Overall, I like the design of the site. First thing I noticed was the ""what is uberessay"" block of text on the left column. I think the way you've written the text is a great attention getter.<p>The biggest issue I have with the usability of the site is navigation and scoping problems.<p>Front page:<p>I like the essay gallery but there is no title associated with it. Are these the most recently added? Today's featured? As it stands now, I did not even realize they were essays, until I clicked on one. Could have been a picture, or user profile? who knows?<p>Navigation:<p>There is no way clear signifier as to what page you are on. You have nice little triangles on hover, but not on ""selected"".<p>The top black navigation bar is fine: Top level pages. \nBut the second red navigation is a bit unintuitive. I assumed these links were sub-links of the top black navigation sections, but they are not. The red bar seems to contain article navigation.<p>So Black = Main Site Navigation, Red = Article Navigation.<p>I guess the placement as they are now is OK, but still seems like the red bar is a sub-set of the black bar. Perhaps adding Description titles to the red bar would help\n""Browse Articles ->""<p>Scope:<p>Similar to the article browsing bar, I think your website has some scoping problems.<p>For example the right tabbed column listing about, recent esssay, recent comments, etc is part of the article browsing functionality, which is also the red nav bar's job.  The right column is also global. Something that confuses me. When I am navigating to a specific article, I see that it shows up under the red nav bar. There is a CLEAR division between what is the top header part of the site, and what is the article space. But then ... within the articles flesh colored space, there's the global article browser tabs. I assume that these tabs should be article specific. In other words I expect the scope of everything on an article page to be relative to that page. Or at least that category.<p>I think users need to have an implicit sense of ""where I am at"" within your website. Ideally when I'm browsing articles, everything should be related to my article browsing task. Then clicking on an article should refine the scope; still browsing articles, but now a subset of articles, i.e the category that the article belongs to, its publisher, etc. ""Other articles by this author"". ""other articles from this category""<p>You are fine with leaving the main stuff where it is, but just be clear on the scope then. Add headers to things.\nAlso the ""about us"" tab does not belong on that right column, imo.<p>Scope!<p>The layout does indeed <i>look</i> organized though. Good job on the design. It's more a matter of being functionally organized.<p>As for content, I'll browse around a bit and maybe add a new comment.<p>Best of luck!",1249777249
