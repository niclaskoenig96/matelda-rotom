Our approaches diverge on virtually every case, as far as I can tell.  My approach would be to apply the exact damage to the aggressor that they applied to the victim, except where the victim forgives all or part (for monetary ""damages"" or some other consideration or reason).  If a mistake is made, the same procedure can be used to rectify it.  This does mean that completely irrevocable damage (that is, death) can't be applied while keeping the property that mistakes can be fixed or paid for.  Murder is already an exceptional situation, not like other crimes of violence, due to its finality.<p>As far as I can tell, your approach (along with the vast majority of existing legal systems today) requires sentencing or damages to be decided individually by a third party, rather than by the parties already involved, which seems inelegant.<p><i>There's also the fact that capital punishment is where this discussion began.</i><p>Oh.  Well, there is something to be said for staying on topic, I suppose. :)",1266116169

Skills (which you have well covered), markets/areas that you love/hate (some people won't touch the enterprise, others would never do a Twitter app), and availability (some people can't afford to go without a salary and some can).<p>The anonymity angle is interesting, but I don't think it's critical.  In fact, it probably hurts.  If I can't read their blog, check out their tweets, or scan their LinkedIn profile, there's generally a lot less for someone to get excited about.

1124042,comment,1123778,1123778,0,0,bonsaitree,,,"This article smells more of self-aggrandizing attitude than sound business reasoning.  I'm amazed that he would bother with the artifice of negotiating when he's essentially unwilling to budge from his friend's price tier.  That's not negotiating.<p>FWIW, contract strikes work just as well (sometimes better) on gym memberships as for any other legal agreement.  If he's willing to pay the ""full price"", but doesn't want to deal with a cumbersome cancellation method, strike that clause and see if they will still approve the membership.  That's a give and take.  That's a negotiation.<p>Either he is deliberately feigning ignorance as fodder for a blog post (likely) or Mr. Steinberg is unaware of how modern gyms, especially ones located in dense urban environments, actually make money.<p>Mainly it's through un/under-utilized memberships and revenue-sharing from ancillary services (personal training, first-aid classes, childbirth classes, etc.) and seminars which can best leverage the uncommon properties of the real estate.<p>What's one business's ""Price Discrimination"" is another's ""Flexible Pricing Strategy"".  A classic example are the near orders-of-magnitude margin differences for the same 1oz. of Coke depending on the customer (vending machine, supermarket, restaurant, stadium).  Same customer, different channel, same product.  For those who remember, a similar strategy was leveraged successfully (for a limited time) by AOL to manage subscriber churn.<p>In this specific example, I highly suspect ""Dan"" joined the gym during a lull point in the calendar year (low-demand) or was a so-called ""charter"" member (pre-paying).  Though likely the same physical space and equipment when ""Dan"" joined, the financial profile & goals of the company which own the facility may be very different today--and, hence, reflected in their membership pricing.<p>That said, there's clearly a market for a ""hassle-free"" gym, but that business model is going to have roughly the same fixed capital costs of other gyms, but get squeezed between low/no-margin YMCAs & county/municipal facilities at the low-end and high-end ""clubs"" (like Crunch) where, sadly, part of the business model's revenue is the social and life-style exclusivity afforded by that membership fee.  In big cities, high-end gyms are the modern equivalent of country clubs.",1266116027

A common form argument is: suppose a leads to not a, therefore a can't be true or suppose a leads to contradiction, therefore a can't be true. Arguments of this form have been made on this topic based on morality (counter arguments exist: cf. Descartes).<p>But I'm not trying to do so, anyway.<p>My argument was solely that the God of the Bible is immoral. As the quote goes: ""even if a God as described in the Bible does exist, he is not fit for worship due to his low moral standards."" There are misotheists who believe Jehova is evil.<p>> Morality is relative to the information one knows. You, not being an omniscient deity, do not have all the information available to make a perfect judgement.<p>I would disagree. I believe that moral absolutes exist and that certain things are intrinsically wrong. I don't need to be omniscient to know that infanticide is wrong. Jehova commits Crimes Against Humanity and Acts of Genocide at several points in the OT.",1266113561

This would give users control over their data (they have a local copy) while allowing it to exist in the cloud as well.  The user would also be able to publish ""deletes"" to tell services indexing her stream to remove a previously published message.<p>Having control of ones data is extremely important however. A push for existing web services to have an open intermediary data is essential, users should be able to backup or migrate their data with ease.",1266113537
1123982,comment,1123873,1123941,0,0,gfodor,,,"Yes, I think in this particular case although it's admirable they moved quickly to correct the major problems this is definitely revealing a weakness in Google's ability to understand humans and their ""irrational"" reactions to products.<p>I posted in an article about Google's data obsession that Google products ""have no soul."" (And was downmodded!) This is an example of what I meant. They are so data driven and engineering focused that I think it was inevitable we'd see them release a product that consumers freak out about.<p>Putting your toe in the water and using data to iterate your way out of problems works great for many of the problems we're trying to solve. But, this problem, they decided, required a ""big bang approach"", since invite only won't generate the network effects. So, you had to get it right on the first try. For problems like this, you need a visionary decision maker with an understanding of human beings and intuition as to how they will react to the product. Someone who puts his or her foot down without being able to necessarily justify why.<p>Google <i>hates</i> intuition, since it's not data driven and is just an opinion. Better to try it, measure it, and prove it. Most of the time, this doesn't burn them. And in fact, it'd be impossible for Google to do what Google does at the scale it does it without this philosophy being burned in deeply to the culture. But this also makes it really, really hard for them to go into social networking with a ""big bang"" as they tried here, since social networking is largely about people, emotions, egos, and feelings and connecting users to other users in a way that triggers the right responses and network effects. It only partially falls back on data & algorithms to make things work well. (Arguably, Facebook got the former part right first, and bolted on data-obsession later, which is why they are winning this war.) Ie, it's not that great of a situation if you have to machine-learn your way towards realizing that someone's ex-husband doesn't belong on their friend list. You've then burned the bridge and it's too late. Better to have someone with common sense step in and avoid the fire.<p>So, I don't think this will be the first time we see Google have to backtrack like this. It was the perfect storm for their major achillies heel to be exposed, and I'm afraid there's not much they can do to correct the root problem since it is a cultural viewpoint that would cause the other areas of their business to suffer.",1266113456
