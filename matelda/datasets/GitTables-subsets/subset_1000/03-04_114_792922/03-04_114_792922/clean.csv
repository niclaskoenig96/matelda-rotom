You will spend every dime of your income on candy and Pokemon figures. You will live in a treehouse in your parents back yard, and girls (or guys) are yucky. Those things may all be awesome. At 20 you might even do some of them for a laugh, but they&#x27;re certainly not life goals anymore.  At 5 years old, you simply couldn&#x27;t conceive of what would be significant at 20.<p>Everything that I wanted at 20 I did - to excess. I exceeded every goal that ever occurred to my 20 year old self. I did it to the point where I grew bored. New things became more exciting. I continued to grow.

Until I left academia I used to work with matlab a lot, and pyexperiment is probably a result of trying to get that experience while making scripts that can easily be shared along with the data needed to run them.<p>E.g., the issue with irreversible mutation of data is addressed in pyexperiment with rotating state (and log) files. For example if you store the state of your experiment in one run, and then change it in the next, you will get a backup of the old state with a numerical extension (by default up to 5 backups are rotated). Moreover, pyexperiment by default comes with commands to display stored state and configuration options (though they still need to be improved), and both are stored in formats compatible with a host of other software (including matlab).<p>Btw., along the same lines, I love ipython notebooks, but the way I use them makes them very hard to share, and compared to plain python scripts, version control is a pain (even with the usual hacks to make diffs readable).",1439264127
