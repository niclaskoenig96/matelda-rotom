The Hi-Tec-C lays down a very nice, smooth line, but it's probably my least favorite because the narrow plastic barrel gets uncomfortable after a few minutes.<p>Out of the other three, the Zebra Sarasa Clip is comfortable to hold, but I don't think it writes quite as smoothly. The Signo and G-2 are both comfortable and smooth-writing... I've tended to favor the G-2 since I've been using some variant of it since high school (nearly 20 years now), and the 0.38 is even nicer. I'll probably end up picking up a few additional Signos though -- they write nearly as smoothly for me and I really like the blue-black color that the G-2 0.38 isn't available in.<p>I find the G-2 is the smoothest overall for me, but this may also be because of the relatively cheap writing pads I use at the office.",1357274777

But after a 6 year, multi-million dollar investigation, the Federal prosecutors didn't charge him with accepting bribes (although they leaked to the press that he did that), they charged him with something like 15 charges of failing to provide ""honest services"". He was convicted of one count, which was subsequently thrown out of the US Supreme Court.<p>Now, a few years later, they are charging him again for some other related charge, a charge that may be thrown out on appeal on double jeopardy grounds if he loses. The objective is basically to bankrupt the man, who is in his mid-80s.<p>Most all white collar crime can be summed up with a few high even charges: fraud, theft, embezzlement, submitting a false instrument.

Crypto involves a lot of complex math and code that, if off by a single bit can wreck the whole house of cards.<p>In general, I think the problem that ORMs face is that they try and match every single problem thrown at them. People criticize your ORM saying ""it doesn't handle egde case XYZ in my legacy data model"" or ""it suffers from this performance problem when somebody puts a tire boot on the server"". Rather than saying ""don't use an ORM to solve your unpaid parking ticket problem"", the ORM team will devise a way of providing multiple method signatures in a language that loosely supports the feature so that unpaid parking tickets will always be paid prior to the server getting a boot.<p>Eventually the support for all these edge cases adds up to a very complex piece of software that, to your point, rivals the complexity and fragility of crypto code.<p>To me... it's more about saying ""I have a limited set of use cases here, I don't need a leatherman to cut this noose around my neck I just need a steak knife"". ActiveRecord is an impressive freaking tool and I don't begrudge anyone for using. If you ship working code using it then it did it's job.<p>My personal taste is to stick with simpler tools that don't have so many edge cases so I can sleep easier at night.<p>Suffice it to say, where you draw the line on ""too complex for my taste"" and where I would draw that line is probably different and the result of both our personal experiences as well as the problems we are trying to solve.",1357274666

This guy spent 27 years at his Grandfather's company and grew its revenues by 5x [1]. That is some pretty serious credibility in the candy business. Not 'huckster'.<p>Then you talk about by giving up 75% you lose control. Which is true, but 100% of 0 is 0. But lets imagine that there is a chance that Arthur can grow the value of this particular company with his knowledge of the candy business and his credibility. If your company is valued at $1M and you own 100%, you give up 75% and with the help of that investor it becomes worth $5M. Your 25% stake is now worth $1.25M.<p>Contrast that with going broke. Having your net worth gro 25% is much better than having it shrink 100%.<p>Then the last lament, which I have heard many many times, is this <i>""The real solution though is to plan things through and not get yourself in the situation of ""needing"" to raise cash or go bust. There are tons of ways to avoid getting stuck is this situation.""</i><p>I think of it as the parallel universe theory of wishfulness, because we know that every decision creates two parallel universes, one where you made the right decision and one where you didn't. The ""right"" answer is not to be in this damn universe but to somehow step across dimensions into that really awesome one. Sadly people get lost looking across at that other universe.<p>It is the <i>opposite</i> of ridiculous here is to take the offer, not dwelling on all of the 'could have been' things, and resolve to learn everything you can about the candy business from this living legend. They have to take your meetings because they are in it to win, not lose their investment. Our entrepreneur is just hitting 30, spend 5 years learning the candy business (its not taught in business school) and then, start yet another candy business. Her 25% stake in this one is much more likely to be worth a decent chunk of change, she will know the people in the industry, and she'll have gone through all of the stages of getting a candy business from where she got it too before, into the big leagues. It will be <i>much</i> easier for her to succeed, and in that new business she will know <i>exactly</i> how much work it is to get into distribution and <i>exactly</i> how to negotiate with contract manufacturers, and <i>exactly</i> how to find the market and increase awareness.

Well, if the economy has been shaped to meet demand from a necessarily contracting customer -- the government -- its structure gets distorted.
