The small ad size of The Deck and some of my networks works well in technology, but in the wedding space you would probably want more conventional sizes. You would also be dealing with larger advertisers which means more of a sales effort, do you have sales experience? (if not it's not very hard, it's just not very fun either)<p>I have also written software to manage running these networks, if you are interested in using it drop me a line (javery at zerkmedia.com).",1261025755

Our prototype apps quite literally had the same workflows and functionality that you'll find today in Latitude. So, when Google announced their intention to release Latitude for the iPhone, we killed the project.<p>Fast forward to today, Apple blocked Latitude from happening on the iPhone and if we'd put in another month or two of work we may have been successful. What's the moral of the story? I guess I might not stop executing in the future just because it looks like the market isn't viable or someone big is poised to eat my lunch. Then again, that could be a recipe to end up penniless or hungry.",1261025538

The general idea of insurance is risk management: I have a huge unpredictable risk which worries me, so I transform it into a small, predictable risk by purchasing insurance.<p>And, true to form, with other types of insurance I pay ""routine"" types of costs myself; for example, I have auto insurance, but I don't expect it to pay for a tank of gas or an oil change. I pay those myself, and have the insurance available for things like accidents, which are unpredictable and far too expensive for me to pay for all in one go.<p>And yet... health insurance tends overwhelmingly to pay for predictable routine treatments (yearly checkups, for example) while balking at paying for precisely the sorts of large unpredictable costs it's meant to help manage.

Euler's law regarding complex exponentials was developed around 1740, but it wasn't until around 1807 when Fourier used it in harmonic analysis and 1897 when Steinmetz started applying it to electrical engineering.<p>But you wouldn't know that from reading a textbook, which is (understandably) arranged in such a way that omits historical context and why people bothered to study it in the first place.
