MP3 at 320 kbps could encode higher fidelity, but when MiniDisc was popular (sic.) most MP3s were recorded at 128 kbps or even 64 kbps with Joint Stereo. Even Apple&#x27;s AAC was encoded at lower quality bitrates for years. It wasn&#x27;t until OGG and lossless WMA seemed like they might put a little pressure on Apple&#x27;s business model that they increased their bitrates and made it possible to remove the DRM. Of course the upshot of all this movement was that MiniDisc was no longer viable for prerecorded content. It still was an adequate poor man&#x27;s DAT for my live recording purposes.",1436676987

That all the most resilient systems, especially in safety-critical space, are microkernels speaks for itself. For instance, MINIX 3 is already quite robust for a system that&#x27;s had hardly any work at all on it. Windows and UNIX systems each took around a decade to approach that. Just the driver isolation by itself goes a long way.<p>Now, I&#x27;d prefer an architecture where we can use regular programming languages and function calls. A number of past and present hardware architectures are designed to protect things such as pointers or control flow. Those in <i>production</i> are not, but have MMU&#x27;s & at least two rings. So, apps on them will both get breached due to inherently broken architecture and can be isolated through microkernel architecture with interface protections, too. So, it&#x27;s really a kludgey solution to a problem caused by stupid hardware.<p>Still hasn&#x27;t been a single monolithic system to match their reliability, security, and maintenance without clustering, though.",1436673874

The efficiency of processors, especially beyond a certain point, hardly makes any difference to the &quot;global economy&quot;.<p>Heck, there are even notable economists saying that the effect of the whole &quot;www&quot; on the economy wasn&#x27;t that special compared to things like the first telecommunications, road and planes.<p>It&#x27;s difficult to see when ones lives and breath in the IT industry echo chamber, but, you know, diminishing returns.<p>The fact that despite 50 years of Moore&#x27;s law we didn&#x27;t have anything like a 8,589,934,592 [1]  times larger global economy, actually not even a 100x larger, should be enough proof that the Moore&#x27;s law doesn&#x27;t have a strong influence on it...<p>[1] 2^((50*12)/18).",1436673816

It&#x27;s a thinly veiled way of saying to someone &quot;you can&#x27;t be trusted to handle a gun/knife/whatever properly&quot; - which, even if true for the majority of humans, is an incredibly offensive and patronizing thing to say to someone.
