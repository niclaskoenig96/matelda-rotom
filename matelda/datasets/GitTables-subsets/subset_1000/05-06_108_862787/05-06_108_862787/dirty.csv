Life is getting more expensive there and from what my friends were telling me, there is an increasingly demand for programmers, therefore the wages are going up.<p>I was thinking about moving back for a while but I don't think this will happen very soon. If anybody would like to talk about Romania some more feel free to email me (email address in the profile).",1192859517

Now, you can upgrade the memory on the white ibook to match the memory of the black one, but if you don't pay an Apple technician 90 dollars an hour plus the cost of parts, you will void your warranty.  These guys are even worse than Microsoft, mostly because Microsoft never pretended to be a good company.  Perhaps ""Assle"" is a more fitting name.<p>And I don't know how Assle's philosophy will mesh with Google's ""don't be evil.""",1192859385
