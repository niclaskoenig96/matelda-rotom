Worse, why are many of them not even happy about it, but still can&#x27;t get out?<p>This hypothesis is basically that that behavior is fueled by a feedback cycle that has, in large part, the actual foods that people eat caught in it somewhere.<p>Now, I think I see what you are getting at.  Could you fix this at other parts of the feedback cycle?  Perhaps.  And I certainly agree that should get research, too.  I just don&#x27;t think this research is unrelated.",1408773213

I&#x27;ve recently spent a lot of &quot;hammock time&quot; trying to come to grips with my views about this profession generally and what I believe is best going forward.  One thing I feel strongly about is that while we are still maturing as a field, the pain points are unacceptable.  There is still so much work to offload to the machine, requiring fundamental rethinking at many levels.  So although I agree in principle with the initiative to help people &quot;learn to code&quot; (so that we can bring system design closer to the domain experts), I also believe that in the current state of things, it&#x27;s a wasteful effort, since it requires conveyance of ideas that should be deprecated.<p>But even short of programming, version control alone would be useful in so many other fields.  There&#x27;s no reason why it shouldn&#x27;t be a mainstream concept even for personal use (e.g., you&#x27;re working on a thesis).  Just an hour ago, during my annual flirtation with Git (I&#x27;m a Mercurial user), I wrote in my notes:<p>> the barrier to entry for new programmers is important.  This would appear to weigh in favor of Mercurial — and yet, realistically, is a “layman,” i.e. someone who knows nothing about software development and has never used a CLI, really going to distinguish between these two systems, or will the very concepts of a VCS not prove to be the biggest hurdle?<p>I have used Git, and I think that for linear history the differences are not remarkable.  But the <i>attitude</i> you refer to is crucial: do we want to hide complexity or expose it?<p>Incidentally, I have several Project Gutenberg epubs under version control for a personal project, and like the OP I attest that their work is first-rate.  There&#x27;s no comparison to any other digitizer in the public domain (that I know of).",1408771394

For me, Amsterdam is one of the places that comes close.  I&#x27;ve been living back and forth between SF/Marin and Amsterdam since 2006.  You&#x27;ll find a buzzing community there around software development, entrepreneurship, and innovation.  (However, if you&#x27;re ever looking for VC funding, the Bay Area is leagues better than the Randstad.)<p>If you&#x27;re looking for an employee-style relationship: To work legally, you&#x27;ll want to find a Dutch company to sponsor you so that you can get a work permit.  Another option is to get hired in the states by a MNC and get transferred.<p>Personally, I elected create a corporation in California, hire myself, and get Dutch clients for our company.  I travel enough that I can make due with the 90 day out of every 6-months visa-free Schengen option.  Dutch companies tend to like to do business with other culturally Dutch companies.  (Technology companies, however,  are generally much more progressive in this regard.) If you go this route, definitely have a Dutch-language web presence and consider having a Dutch-speaking sales person as these will work wonders.<p>Also, if you&#x27;re into cars, one very cool thing about NL and neighboring Germany is that you can rent proper german cars, like M3&#x27;s and Porsche turbos.  In NL the traffic can be a bit crowded and you have to watch out for the camera boxes (Gatso&#x27;s).  I recommend taking the ICE train over to Düsseldorf.  They have a very nice selection of cars at the DÜS airport and the A3 is great for some autobahn therapy.<p>Let me know if there&#x27;s anything or anyone I can help you get connected with in NL.",1408771349

Warning, it&#x27;s not exactly light reading:<p><pre><code>  ftp://ftp.ecn.purdue.edu/qobi/fdlcc.pdf\n</code></pre>\nAlthough the subject is nominally closure conversion, he describes how flow analysis is used to propagate information about values around the compiler&#x27;s model of the program. Because the analysis is on a whole program basis it need not be very conservative - in a whole program compiler you never have to give up and do something the slow way because a value might be used in a place you can&#x27;t see.<p>This aggressive flow analysis gives the compiler enough information to pick nice flat C-like representations, inline objects inside other objects, use more specialised calling conventions, etc.<p>For example, a whole program compiler might determine that the elements of an array are never compared with eq or have their mutable parts assigned to, which could allow the elements to be inlined into the array. Doing this is tough or impossible in a traditional compiler because the contents of files that have yet to be compiled is unknown, forcing the compiler to assume the worst.<p>Pretty neat stuff.",1408770823
