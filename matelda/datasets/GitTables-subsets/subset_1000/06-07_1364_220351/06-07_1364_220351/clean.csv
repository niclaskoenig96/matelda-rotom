In fact, sometimes the Mac has almost too many options; the Mac ships with something like 5 text editors, and that's before realizing there are excellent 3rd party ones too.<p>It's clear that Windows <i>can be made</i> tolerable with some effort, but I've sort of lost patience with having to do what a company with Microsoft's money should be able to provide by itself.<p>My last exposure to Visual Studio was version 2005, and it started with the realization that the program was basically incapable of saving to the previous version of its own file format (which completely threw off my version control on a project where all other team members were stuck with older IDEs).  I also remember with disdain opening Visual Studio 2005 and being given about 15 characters of space in which to type a series of ""#include"" search paths; I kid you not, it was faster to mount a network drive, open Linux and ""vim"", and edit the project XML file directly, than it was to futz with Microsoft's poorly-thought-out GUI to perform the same tasks.<p>I'm willing to allow that I've just had some bad experiences, and I hear so much praise for Microsoft's environments that I constantly feel like I must just be missing something.  Yet everything I've seen doesn't make me think ""snappy"", it makes me think ""kludgey, buggy, poorly-conceived mess from company with enough money to do much, much better"".",1312872766

Not at least in the sense of classic learning, as in learning well.<p>Why don't you check with the way you start to learn. Is it laziness? Lack of interest or motivation? Is is just that you daydream about everything happening just the way you want but never actually doing anything for that? Or what?<p>I do not see (IMHO) you as an ambitious person (no offence) but I see you as a dreamer maybe, which is good to start with. You are not ambitious because that will be you using fullest of your abilities.<p>You have one plus point though, you are just 20.<p>Here's my suggestion. It's not related to programming.

There's a lot wrong here.<p>For starters, philosophers are plenty comfortable with the limits of rationality, and were poking at that long before Gdel came along. Similarly, ""using logic to understand everything"" is a pretty sweeping generalization, and one which quite likely commits an equivocation the way you're trying to use it.<p>As for analytic philosophy, well, you seem to have a lot of misconceptions about what exactly that means. Analytic philosophy's certainly done its fair share of dumb things, but blowing off Gdel for showing ""the limits to logic""? Not sure where you get that one from; for the most part, analytic philosophers have been spending the last century or so on things like the problem of demarcation; Gdel's work with respect to formal systems is basically irrelevant to that and to plenty of other things philosophers spend their time on.",1312869643
