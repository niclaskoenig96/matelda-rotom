Ransomware shares plenty of traits with regular malware.<p>The problem is that there are so many cheap services out there for malware distributors to automatically &quot;crypt&quot; (pack) their payloads, that the chances of getting a completely fresh sample are pretty high.<p>AVs are also less effective against ransomware because they have to catch it before it first runs on the system, otherwise there&#x27;s nothing it can do.",1392965965

The\nAnarchist version of Libertarianism is mostly speculative fiction, although it can be good spec. fic. David Friedman&#x27;s one of the best people I&#x27;ve ever read.<p>The &quot;magic&quot; is called &quot;consumer surplus&quot; and it&#x27;s one of the few defensible things in macroeconomics. It&#x27;s quite real.<p>The paradox is that explicitly trying to do things for the greater good very often backfires - although not always.<p>But as a &quot;control law&quot; - in the sense of running a distributed, massive system - self-interest produces measurably better results than Soviet-style central planning. This rests on information-theoretic foundations and it&#x27;s early days yet. We&#x27;re pathetic at macroeconomics, and it&#x27;s a lot captured by both whim of the moment.<p>Of course, now we have a lot of hybrids, some that work much better than free markets, some that don&#x27;t.

Every technology product has at least the choice to not use it.</i><p>But that&#x27;s exactly the problem: many of the modern technologies that pose potential risks to privacy <i>don&#x27;t</i> in practice provide an opt-out for the people whose privacy they might infringe.<p>Sometimes, you do have a choice. However, if you don&#x27;t know about it or understand the implications, you can&#x27;t make an informed decision.<p>Sometimes you don&#x27;t get any meaningful choice, for example if governments decide it&#x27;s OK to share sensitive healthcare information now. Strictly speaking you do have a choice, but that choice is never to visit a doctor or hospital. Try contrasting the dangers from a significant reduction in public trust in the integrity and ethics of the entire medical profession with the hypothetical future benefits of analysing aggregate healthcare data, and let me know which one really seems like the bigger risk.<p>Sometimes you don&#x27;t get any choice in practice because your data is collected incidentally. When you were in the background of someone&#x27;s personal holiday snap, that didn&#x27;t really matter. When you&#x27;re in the background of a CCTV image, which is centrally recorded and subject to future data mining operations, it matters more. When you&#x27;re in the background of numerous CCTV images just because you left your home, which are subject to geotagging, facial recognition, gait analysis, covert audio recording, correlation with other databases such as mobile phone history, ANPR scans and purchase history, permanent archival and any additional data mining techniques that anyone who gets hold of the data might find later... Well, now you&#x27;re in the plot of a sci-fi short story that doesn&#x27;t end well.<p>Except that of course, it&#x27;s not a story any more. Insurers already bump premiums based on profiling, but that profiling is notoriously inaccurate. Lenders already check credit records, which again are notoriously inaccurate. Employers already not only Google job applicants but in some cases also ask for personal log-in credentials to read through their social networking history. Governments already sell personal data held for legitimate public interest reasons to private parties, and even in seemingly simple cases like the government&#x27;s vehicle licensing authority in the UK providing details of the registered owner of a car with given plates, this has been widely abused. Where these things have been curtailed -- which doesn&#x27;t happen nearly as often as it should -- it has mostly been because primary legislation was passed or the rules for government&#x27;s own departments were updated to cover specific cases, and only after so many people suffered from the intrusion that it became a politically significant issue.<p>To be clear, I don&#x27;t object to the idea that there are potentially great benefits to be had from data mining, including in sensitive cases like public health data. But I think you are almost completely ignoring the accompanying risks, despite a seemingly endless stream of failures resulting in serious adverse consequences for individuals whose privacy wasn&#x27;t adequately protected. We need the rest of how society works to catch up with the capabilities of modern technology before we can reap the benefits without paying too high a price.",1392965345

Just this week, the latest attempt to do this in the UK, the care.data programme, essentially became so politically toxic that it&#x27;s dead.<p>This happened for a number of reasons. Some of them were just incompetence, like claiming everyone would receive a leaflet explaining the proposals and the right to opt out, and then finding that not only was your leaflet heavily criticised <i>by medical and IT professionals</i> for being woefully misleading, but when surveyed about 2/3 of adults reported not having seen it anyway. That was the credibility of the programme operators you saw falling down the sinkhole.<p>However, other reasons for objecting would have stood up even if everyone were fully informed. The data in question wasn&#x27;t actually going to be available to clinicians like doctors and nurses who might find it useful when providing care. And contrary to the laudible-sounding goals that some medical professionals have suggested, much like those you have been advocating yourself in this discussion, it also wasn&#x27;t going to be restricted to people like medical researchers.<p>In fact -- and it <i>is</i> now well-established, beyond-any-doubt, clear-as-day fact -- the data could never have been protected to the extent that was claimed (numerous qualified people have debunked the effectiveness of the claimed pseudonymisation), and the proposed rules and &quot;safeguards&quot; for who would have access to the data and for what purposes weren&#x27;t even close to restricting it to legitimate medical research of the kind you describe. Those advocating the scheme at government level have once again demonstrated a fundamental lack of understanding of the implications of this kind of technology. There are a few other questions that seem to have been brushed under the carpet, too, like how opting out would supposedly mean your information never physically left your GP&#x27;s systems, yet paradoxically there were circumstances discussed a couple of weeks ago where some organisations, like police and security services, would be able to access the data centrally via the new system anyway.<p>The trouble with many of these privacy issues we&#x27;ve been discussing recently -- whether it&#x27;s Google-esque creepy mass surveillance, or the NHS plans to consolidate and share particularly sensitive data about individuals, or governments monitoring surveillance networks -- is that they are all cases of Pandora&#x27;s box. Once you&#x27;ve compelled people to give up privacy and they&#x27;ve been entered into someone&#x27;s database, that data is out there, and it&#x27;s subject to redistribution and repurposing at any future time, with or without the blessing of the data subjects. Our privacy laws are dangerously underweight and already fail to balance the heavyweight capabilities of modern technologies. Until that gets fixed -- and I mean fixed in the sense that privacy laws are actually enforced and respected at government level -- the only reasonable conclusion is that we should err on the side of caution with giving up personal data, and challenge every attempt to push the boundaries to make sure it&#x27;s justified.",1392964022

I&#x27;m also not entirely sure how much I can say, so I&#x27;m skipping things.<p>Most banks use what we term &quot;bank-in-a-box&quot; software provided by one of two vendors:<p>FIS - <a href=""http://www.fisglobal.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fisglobal.com/</a>\nFiserv - <a href=""http://www.fiserv.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fiserv.com/</a><p>In fact, just about the only ones who aren&#x27;t using a complete bank-in-a-box solution are the megabanks, for example: BofA, Wells Fargo, Chase.<p>The upside of using a bank-in-a-box solution is that you can spin it up almost immediately and at very little cost (relatively). The downside is that you&#x27;re running technology that, very often, was written last decade. For example: <a href=""https://secure.ally.com/allyWebClient/login.do"" rel=""nofollow"">https://secure.ally.com/allyWebClient/login.do</a> uses jQuery 1.3.2, released in 2009.<p>But worst of all, you can&#x27;t really differentiate yourself from your competitors–they&#x27;re using the same thing under the hood. In order to begin the process of differentiation you typically see banks progress through stages out of dependence upon these solutions.<p>1. First you enable service calls into the system of record (SoR).<p>2. Then you Balkanize your services, calling back and forth between your BiaB solution and your own custom component which reaches out to the SoR through services instead of the hosted, white-labeled BiaB. This is terribly slow. Remember what I said about last-decade technology?<p>3. Eventually a bank completely migrates completely to service calls on the backend to the SoR. But they still haven&#x27;t implemented any of the reporting or back-of-house processing.<p>4. The ambitious banks then start trying to move the SoR and the back-of-house processing and reporting (this is a big deal) in-house. However, to work, this has to be a one-time switchover since &quot;eventually consistent&quot; is <i>not</i> a valid state for bank data.<p>Almost everybody stops before attempting Step 4. It starts getting expensive and hard really fast at that point–and almost no bank has that appetite for risk. However, even if you attempt Step 4, the legacy of your technical decisions has resulted in loosely coupled and often poorly integrated experiences wherein even pulling your data in-house likely doesn&#x27;t fix it. At this point Step 5 is digging out of your technical debt, and I&#x27;ve yet to see any bank succeed at that.<p>Simple skipped Steps 1 & 2. They never incurred Step 5. They were insulated from Step 4 by using a holding bank. Step 3 was why they took so long to launch. On a technical level Simple is years ahead of every bank out there. Features they had the data for could be implemented in no time. Organizationally their mission was clear enough that everybody bought in. Their race, which I&#x27;ve said numerous times, was to catch up to Ally&#x27;s marketing and deposit assets before Ally (or others) catches up to their technology. It&#x27;s an asymmetric race, but not being a bank means that Simple couldn&#x27;t leverage fractional reserve banking to its fullest which cuts into profit margins and makes it much harder to succeed. Their acquisition price implies to me that their burn rate was too high for their revenues to make the long game sustainable.<p>Contrast with BofA: &quot;We spend, just overall, about $3 billion and change in annual technology development.&quot;",1392963203
