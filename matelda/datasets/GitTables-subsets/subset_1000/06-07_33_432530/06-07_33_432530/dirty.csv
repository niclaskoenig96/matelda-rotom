It seems right that you should be able to peacefully question any non-emergency procedure, expect basic respect even if you're not being the most pleasant person, and retreat a step or two reflexively if you feel threatened.<p>Of course, we know that the <i>practical</i> approach to take is to be docile, passive, sickeningly submissive, and compliant nearly to the point of being patronizing.<p>The border guards train and drill repeatedly on how to behave aggressively and militantly in this situation.  Most adults have no corresponding practice at acting completely flaccid and defenseless on command, which is what it seems we've come to expect.",1260600817

My only point is that, when there are people out there who are trying to blow you up, dealing with a certain amount of bullshit from law enforcement is an acceptable tradeoff for putting a stop to that. It's not optimal, but neither is dying in a terrorist attack. Neither extreme--fascism or doing nothing--appeals to me as much as the middle ground. YMMV.",1260600270

991257,comment,990323,990791,0,0,wvenable,,,"> It's bank's responsibility to keep the system running and secure, not mine.<p>As others have pointed out, it is your responsibility to check your bank statements to ensure that all is secure.  But also, with banks you're dealing with money that is easily replaceable.  If your card is compromised that money is <i>gone</i> but if it's their fault (or criminal) the bank will replace that money.  Your data is not replaceable -- when it's gone, it's gone.<p>""Many of us host something somewhere. How many do backups? How many of us check the backups? How many do check the backups checking process?""<p>True you do have to stop somewhere -- but there is due diligence and there's negligence.  Making sure you are making offsite backups and periodically testing them is due diligence.  On the otherhand, completely relying on someone else to backup your critical data is negligence.  If your data is at all important to you, then you need to have a copy.  But at some point you have to accept that you've done enough.",1260599281

Using a visual designer, you can easily create different versions of your website/landing page for optimizing your website goals (such as signups, sales, downloads, clicks, newsletter subscriptions, etc). Running the test on a website does not repetitive require making any code changes (or page tagging) to it. My tool fills the gaps left by Google's offering and other commercial split testing tools by dramatically simplifying the conversion rate optimization process for the non-technical users.<p>Please use the invite code ""hacker-news"" while signing up here http://visualwebsiteoptimizer.com<p>Looking forward to healthy dose of feedback, criticism and comments from the community.
