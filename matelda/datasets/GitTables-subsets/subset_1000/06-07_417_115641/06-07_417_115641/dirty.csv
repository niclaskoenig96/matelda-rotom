Becoming a commercial airline pilot requires <i>many</i> hours in the cockpit. A great way to accomplish that is to become a USAF pilot. Your flight training is paid for (in fact, you get a salary to attend). You have a commitment (if you did ROTC it works out to 7-10 years total, flight training takes up the first part of that). Then you can get out, join the guard or reserve and work full-time for 6 figures, and part-time to earn a second retirement (a modest retirement, but gov&#x27;t service is one of the few remaining sources for pensions).<p>EDIT: Also, a huge difference between heavies (commercial aircraft, cargo aircraft, refuelers, bombers) and fighters. They handle very differently, and pilots confusing the performance of one for the other can cause serious problems.",1391236886

7161043,comment,7160076,7160076,1,0,jankins,,,"One idea is it might not necessarily be either/or -- I&#x27;d suggest that you first release one version, whichever payment model your gut is pulling you toward. Wait until you have some data, maybe 4-6 months of sales history. If sales are gangbusters, maybe you&#x27;ll feel that you&#x27;ve already got the right sales model. If you have a hunch that sales could be better and that a different sales model may be a major driver of additional revenue, you can release another version under the opposite payment model, and observe what happens to overall sales.<p>Personally I&#x27;ve preferred the Paid model. I have one app in the store, and the main driver of revenue increase has come from delivering updates which give more value to the user, and increasing the price accordingly (monthly revenue is up 8x on average since a major update & a price increase from 2.99 to 8.99). I haven&#x27;t taken my own advice above yet, though I have built the IAP version -- I haven&#x27;t released it yet because so far other experiments have been effective in increasing sales and less risky. I recall Marco Arment mentioned a major source of revenue increase for Instapaper was when he killed the free version.

If they&#x27;re done locally, then people who migrate are a problem for the statistics: it&#x27;s very easy to move from bottom quintile to top quintile, just move from Palo Alto to rural Oklahoma.

It&#x27;s a much better use of energy to focus on cultivating a quiet confidence, rather than attempting to build up a collection of manipulative &quot;power tricks&quot; to be deployed in an inauthentic fashion.<p>Another thing to recognize is that people who <i>are</i> confident will pick up on the motives of these power tricks, because they&#x27;ll sense an incongruity in character during communication.  When someone who is typically timid and passive acts in an aggressive manner, it stands out like a nerd taking a swing at the jock.  Even worse, confident people will push back to see if the user of said &quot;power trick&quot; is for real, which requires the next &quot;power trick&quot; to keep up the act.<p>So yeah, these might work on some people, but I personally intensely dislike it when I pick up on these things.

These commercial pilots get thousands of hours per year of flying, which is often much more than a full-time Airman would get.<p>That being said, I agree that some of the author&#x27;s arguments were very weak. For example, the suggestion that hosting morale boosting activities in the middle of a training exercise is somehow a sign of mission-failure. With the possible exception of North Korea, everyone does that. Hell, there was even a group of terrorists that played soccer daily inside a hostage-filled building surrounded by teams of special forces and law enforcement that wanted to kill them.",1391235019

Also, it only took the Chinese a month to get what they wanted[2].<p><i>Not to be outdone by the conventional army, China’s powerful strategic rocket troops, the Second Artillery Force, still uses cavalry units to patrol its sprawling missile bases deep within China’s vast interior.</i><p>Is there any evidence apart from some staged pictures of some event that this is actually true?<p><i>the Air Force continues to use a 1950s Soviet designed airframe, the Tupolev Tu-16, as a bomber (its original intended mission), a battlefield reconnaissance aircraft, an electronic warfare aircraft, a target spotting aircraft, and an aerial refueling tanker. Likewise, the PLA uses the Soviet designed Antonov An-12 military cargo aircraft for ELINT (electronic intelligence) missions, ASW (anti-submarine warfare) missions, geological survey missions, and airborne early warning missions. It also has an An-12 variant specially modified for transporting livestock, allowing sheep and goats access to remote seasonal pastures.</i><p>Interestingly, the C-130 is still in use by US forces for most of the uses listed above. It first flew in 1954[3]. The B-52 remains the primary US bomber. It first flew in 1952[4].<p><i>Take the PLA’s lack of combat experience, for example. A few minor border scraps aside, the PLA hasn’t seen real combat since the Korean War. This appears to be a major factor leading it to act so brazenly in the East and South China Seas.</i><p>The more aggressive Chinese position in the South China Sea is possibly the most important strategic development in the last 5 years (and of course it has pretty much been ignored by most media). Saying it is caused by PLA leadership while ignoring the <i>HUGE OIL AND GAS RESERVES</i> the area has is a pretty major oversight (One of the Chinese leadership&#x27;s biggest concerns is how dependant it is on overseas sources of energy, and how easily those sources could be cut off. A source of oil and gas in Chinese controlled waters is something they see as a major goal, and they may well be willing to fight for it).<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Indian_War"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Indian_War</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Indian_War#Ceasefire"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Indian_War#Ceasefire</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_C-130_Hercules"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_C-130_Hercules</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_B-52_Stratofortress"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_B-52_Stratofortress</a>",1391234609
