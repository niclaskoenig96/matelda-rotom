The gate in a film projector(or camera), the steam valve block on many steam engines, even the gear selector drum assembly on a motorcycle gearbox - and the mechanical gubbins inside every lightswitch displays the sort of hysteresis you need. I bet a typical 1950&#x27;s engineer would solve that problem for you in a dozen ways in 20 minutes. (these days I suspect many engineers today would reach for a microcontroller and a servomotor or solenoid...)",1401523029
7825514,story,,,11,9,confusedanon,"Ask HN: How do you decide what to do in your working life?",,"In my twenties I happily worked as a software engineer/coder, enjoying the technical challenges presented to me in my daily working life, and carrying on my personal life without any significant worries. However in my thirties I&#x27;ve become increasingly anxious about what I&#x27;m achieving, which I think has got to the point of affecting everything through a lack of self-esteem. I&#x27;ve seen some helpful responses to personal topics on HN, so thought I might present my own little crisis of confidence.<p>On the one hand, I have become cynical about busting a gut working for someone else while they reap far greater rewards. On the other, I just can&#x27;t decide on what else to do instead. I get home and just want to learn a new software language, or write some code for one hobby interest or another - but then curse myself for &#x27;wasting&#x27; time - not really solving my issue.<p>Possibly the only solution is to start my own company - be that one-man or otherwise. And then the decision is whether it&#x27;s a product or service. But I immediately then doubt I have that entrepreneurial spirit, making me feel even more trapped. The other thought I have is going into some kind of academic career, which I think my suit my nature, were it not for my worry about low remuneration.<p>Another thing I&#x27;ve become cynical about is what I perceive as very low &#x27;respect&#x27; for what I (or software engineers generally) do in life compared to others in the world. It&#x27;s as if I&#x27;m just a faceless expendable resource, and the people that are actually valuable are the people directing things. It seems as though even the lowest level manager, in the lowest level job, has more value simply because they, well, &#x27;manage&#x27;. However, I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s a symptom or a cause of how I&#x27;m feeling right now.<p>How do you decide what to do in your working life? Does anyone here have a similar experience that they rectified?",1401522756

7825506,comment,7822912,7822912,1,0,ClashTheBunny,,,"I feel that the article does a good job of lauding the position for low entry, but it lacks an absolute perspective.  For example, today email is generally viewed by people as a double edged sword because of the ease of entry for people sending.  People sometimes still view Wikipedia with scepticism because of the low cost of entry to add your personal views to the system.  Chat roulette, which was a great idea, became a haven for people who wanted to expose themselves.  All three cases are situations where a low barrier of entry has either taken a army of content curators (either software or human) or driven the service into obscurity.  How does this solve the issue of either making ngrok a double edged sword or something that the general public will be warned about in a 20 second context-less news blurb?",1401522337

7825495,comment,7825376,7825376,7,0,leonth,,,"Greetings. I was exactly at the same position two years ago but decided to get my license and work as a pharmacist instead.<p>I am not sure how invested you are against working as a pharmacist, but I would humbly suggest that you at least do that for a while (perhaps 1 to 2 years). Being both an experienced healthcare professional and hacker/developer enables very wide career opportunities. You will be the most tech-savvy pharmacist in the department/company. You will be the most efficient in any kind of data analysis (because your peers are having trouble learning to use Excel Pivot Table while you are writing scripts that take the files as input and perform 1000 Pivot Tables in a second). You will be tasked to be the go-to person for anything remotely related to the million-dollar enterprise software the pharmacy uses. You will get to be involved in the most technologically advanced project the pharmacy is having (think automation, robots, electronic medical records).<p>In the startup world, the professional status gives you instant, significant positive reputation gap as compared to your usual competent-developer-without-domain-knowledge kind. Not to mention the advantage of having extensive domain knowledge should you manage to find an idea that somehow involves pharmacy.<p>After that, you can slowly think to get your CS degree (as I am thinking of getting in the near future), or just do the Coursera courses along the way. As you would have some experience working as a pharmacist already, this credential (plus all the experience being involved in pharmacy IT projects) would stay even after you get the CS credentials.<p>[PS: I&#x27;m in Singapore working in a public hospital here.]",1401521856

With code, you can spend a week refactoring a section of your project, and conclude with certainty that it&#x27;s better written. With design, you try to do the same, and get 60% of people agreeing it&#x27;s the right direction, and 40% saying you&#x27;re going the wrong way. This creates a lot of internal conflicts, and noise as you try to reach your goal. I was hoping this talk was going to go into some specifics of how we <i>can</i> measure great design, and how we can clear some of that noise and have more confidence in our decisions.<p>However, it seemed like the talk stopped after the intro, then it spent 30 minutes showcasing some odds and ends from his past work.",1401521755

7825474,comment,7825376,7825376,5,0,arghnoname,,,"Generally speaking, at least in the USA, having an agree from a relatively well regarded school counts for a lot more than listing some Coursera certifications on your resume. This is especially true earlier in your career when education is a bigger factor than experience.<p>Part of the reason for this is while you say they are &#x27;exactly the same&#x27; I think there is a lot of skepticism that this is true. With the university system, most of us got our degrees and have a better sense of what that degree means. If it is from a school of a certain caliber, we know the minimum statement that makes. For Coursera, that&#x27;s just not as clear unless you&#x27;ve gone to the trouble of doing both. I believe a Coursera educated person can (and perhaps maybe often even is due to self selection, who knows) be more knowledgeable than a person educated more traditionally. I&#x27;d still see hiring a Coursera person as a bigger risk because it is less of a known factor.<p>As an aside, in the US system those sound more like Master&#x27;s courses than undergraduate courses. This is part of the confusion on what Coursera should count as. No one wants to look into the curriculum themselves, see how exams were proctored, projects administered, etc. That&#x27;s what accreditation bodies and institutional reputation are for.
