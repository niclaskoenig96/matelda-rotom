Typical now is 2 to 4.<p>And while I agree that the most popular language will be something brand new, it's based more on non-public information I've seen.<p>I'm not sure I agree with your ""superiority theory"".  Languages become popular because of the core problem they're solving.  C++ was popular when Windows came out, Java when the web took off.  The next big language will be able to handle multi-threading easily, so that when we hit 64 cores, it won't be a waste.",1235807936

498080,comment,497314,497617,0,0,cos,,,"Generally, I just use my own (co-located) DNS server from my laptop.  However, I sometimes run into problems with wireless providers away from home, especially at airports: sometimes they have it set up such that you have to log in or pay at a URL that they expect the local DNS resolver (which their DHCP will have handed you) to resolve to the <i>local</i> server.<p>So, for example, foo.someprovider.net when resolved at City Airport using the local DNS server will point to an IP handling payment/login for City Airport, but the very same hostname foo.someprovider.net at OtherCity Airport will resolve to a different IP that happens to be the payment/login server on the local net at OtherCity Airport.<p>I've run into other instances of this.  Basically, not taking the DNS server that DHCP hands you, sometimes causes problems.  Usually you can figure out what's happening and change your settings, so it's an annoyance rather than a real failure.",1235806287

Besides being a PITA for the boss this also effectively neuters the account team. Not ideal.",1235806050

It seems, for instance, that Boulder has attracted a fair amount of angels, startups and the like, despite (or maybe because of) being a fairly small town in proportion to the bay area.  For instance, if I made a pile of money, I would not live in the bay area (I don't live there anyway, so maybe I won't make a pile of money, either:-).
