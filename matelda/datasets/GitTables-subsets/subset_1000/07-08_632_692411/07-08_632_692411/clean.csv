The purpose of intuition is to guide you in developing proofs or solving problems.  Feel free to use your own intuition and reject that of others.  If you're not going to be proving theorems or solving problems, there's nothing wrong with having an intuition at odds with everyone else's.<p>However, as a data point, the intuition that's developed over the last two centuries or so, the one you reject, seems to work in proving theorems and solving problems.<p>The concepts of infinity contain much that seems contradictory.  Intuitions based on your finite world simply don't work.  The best way to develop new ones is to work with these things, or to accept the visualisations that others provide.",1276328258

Producing those huge volumes of documents can be quite challenging.<p>For example, someone in litigation with Google might hit Google with a discovery request saying ""We want all documents, memos, and emails pertaining to search spam.""  That is, conservatively, millions of documents.  So Google has to grab every email a Googler has ever written, <i>then</i> winnow that set down to just the relevant ones, then have lawyers pick through and exclude the ones protected by privilege, then get those hundreds of thousands of pages in a lawyer-accessible format delivered to the opposing party within a very tight timeframe.<p>This is challenging on Big Freaking Enterprise scales.

It is what's true, and I'm trying to help you visualise it.<p><pre><code>    >> Your problem seems to be that you are trying to\n    >> visualise this in terms of finite collections and\n    >> finding inconsistencies/contradictions.\n\n    > Yes, when you start using imprecise terms like\n    > ""almost all"", you're talking about intuition, and\n    > our intuitions are of course based on finite sets.\n</code></pre>\nNot when you've worked for sufficiently long with these things.  As you work with them - not just learn the definitions and a few standard proofs - you start to gain an intuition for what's really going on.  People are trying to help you gain that intuition by telling you these things, and you're simply rejecting it and arguing from your existing intuition.<p><pre><code>    > I think your problem is that you think that one set\n    > of math facts (including probability, measure, lack\n    > of a bijection) that is sort of analogous to an\n    > intuition of finite sets, is the preferred viewpoint,\n    > over another set of math facts (infinity of rationals\n    > between reals) in shaping your intuition.\n\n    > To your credit, all mathematicians seem to be on\n    > your side:)\n</code></pre>\nMy intuition isn't just based on a few facts, it's based on working with these things for years, and the intuition developed.<p>And the cardinality of the reals isn't just ""a bit bigger"".  Cantor's standard proof may have left you with that feeling, but go back to the proof I gave earlier.  Start with a countable collection of reals.  The standard diagonal argument gives you one that's missing. Now look at just how many ways you can generate new reals from that one list.  You can take the first from the second and the second fromthe first, 3rd from 4th and 4th from 3rd, etc.  In fact, any permutation of the infinite list (with certain restrictions as to hitting everything) gives you missing elements.<p>It's not just ""a slippery bit bigger"" (a term for which you have given me no efinition and no intuition), it's <i>enormously</i> bigger.<p>The one intuition you come back to is the ""in between"" bit.  Again I give you the example of the evens.  Surely since between every pair of even numbers there's an integer, that means there must be more integers?  No, it doesn't, and it's just like that.<p>You say that because there are infinitely many rationals between each pair of reals then there must be a similar number of reals (ok, maybe ""a slippery bit more"").  Well, no, that's not true.  It just isn't like that.<p>In short, your existing intuition is leading you astray, you haven't worked enough with the infinities and their applications to develop an appropriate intuition, and you're rejecting every attempt to help you gain the right intuition.<p>So I'll stop there until you can help me understand your problem better.",1276327870

From my understanding of the word civil, your comment is questionable. I may be too sensitive, but your comment strikes me as one that attempted to show no respect and even try to hurt my feelings.
