They never ship because the technical team can't build a product on a timeline.  They can't figure out the problem, they don't code well enough to scale beyond 1000 lines of code, they don't know how to say NO to the business side clamoring for useless features, and so on.<p>Yes, a lot of products get built and are useless and never sell, but far more are ideas floating in minds that are never even built to completion.<p>A good technical team will execute, execute quickly, scale and be far ahead of most competition who doesn't value the technical side.",1309506530

The positive aspects are mostly rooted in that your coworkers tend to be really driven, creative individuals.<p>I know of a few particular studios with a reputation for having good work environments, but in general, the nature of the industry causes bad managers and directors to rise to the top because it's impossible to reliably connect bad results with bad decisions.<p>On the other hand, I know lots of people who still like their industry jobs. I think for them, putting up with dysfunctional management is okay because they get enough out of the job otherwise to make it a fair trade. It's also possible to diminish the destructive effects of the job if you're strong-willed and productive - crunch is a good example.

It certainly has its annoyances but it has a nice ecosystem (= people to help you out, open source code to learn from and packages to do just about anything you need). It also has the best employment opportunities.<p>Once you're comfortable with Django have a look at some of the other frameworks such as Flask or Tornado - they may suit your way of thinking better and may be more suitable for certain projects (for example GAE stuff). There's no need to get pigeon-holed into one framework.<p>Whatever you do, however, avoid web2py - it messes with Python internals in nasty ways and will teach you bad habits:<p><a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/ex54j/seeking_clarification_on_pylonsturbogearspyramid/c1bo1v5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/ex54j/seeking_clarif...</a>",1309504943

The whole moving target thing makes it hard to comply with all the edge cases at all times, obviously.  I would not be surprised if there are now test262 tests that are testing the old language, and will need to be fixed just like browsers will need to be fixed.<p>> Your argument about Intranet apps not coded to standards\n> seems circular.<p>I wasn't making an argument; just stating a fact.<p>But note that the non-standard assumptions that intranet apps make are not even in the sort of things that 262test shows as broken in browsers: the latter tend to be somewhat esoteric due to the obvious fact that browsers sort of agree on the JS used on the web.  But intranet apps tend to be coded to particular DOM quirks (in areas where the standard often doesn't define behavior to start with), particular HTML parsing quirks (until recently there was no standard for parsing HTML), and so forth.<p>Or put another way, intranet apps have a tendency to find situations where there is no behavior defined by a standard and depend on behavior in those situations, when the smart thing to do would be to avoid those situations entirely.",1309504478
