9246093,comment,9245862,9246059,0,0,EdwardDiego,,,"> Similarly to being raised in a cult, the internet gives people the ability to spend most of their time in a community that reinforces their world view while forcing out any dissenting view points.<p>This has always been my thinking around the more unusual subcultures closely tied to the Internet such as vores etc.<p>Prior to the net, if your fetish was being eaten by a dragon, chances are it was yours and yours alone within your accessible social circles. Espousing it openly would lead (rightly or wrongly, I make no judgement, each to his own) to social ridicule at best, ostracism at worst. But with the internet, you can now find like-minded groups who will tell you that your interest in being eaten by dragons is entirely normal. People who join those communities to disagree will usually be banned or removed somehow.<p>I&#x27;ve chosen an extreme example, but you&#x27;ll find similar in other online subcultures - in my opinion, the smaller, the more likely the group-think.",1427014714

9246080,comment,9243169,9243459,0,0,smelendez,,,"It&#x27;s interesting that so few people can define, or fully explain, MVC.<p>I wonder how the success rate would change if you defined &quot;model,&quot; &quot;view&quot; and &quot;controller,&quot; and asked why developers might choose to organize projects in such a way.<p>My guess is that most working developers would get the concept right away and might even be able to relate it to other named models we&#x27;ve seen--we might just all exist in a web bubble where MVC is trendy because of the levels of abstraction that exist in our common toolsets.<p>Even Cobol&#x27;s ancient &quot;divisions&quot; seem to have a similar organizational structure (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL#Features"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL#Features</a>) and so, I&#x27;m sure, did a lot of old-school, green screen terminal apps.<p>Our computers are generally fast enough and our tools good enough for what we&#x27;re asking them to do that we can often just define data models and user views fairly abstractly--index this, make that an input box rounded corners and indented text--and that we can often avoid delving into the low-level details of how data&#x27;s stored or pixels laid out on the screen. I&#x27;m sure it would be possible to describe an operating system, or a video game engine, or a DBMS in terms of which sections of code model data, handle the meat-and-potatoes &quot;business logic&quot; and communicate with the outside world, but you&#x27;d probably need deeper layers of abstraction to actually plan how code would be organized.<p>We also have enough fast memory that we can basically pass data from one level to another without issue and don&#x27;t have to deal with abstraction-breaking optimizations like processing data while a disk head or spinning drum is in the right place or before an old video game system&#x27;s tiny RAM chip is full.<p>But I think programmers who worked with those kinds of systems could quickly jump into web and app development, and if they couldn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s probably not because they don&#x27;t know what MVC stands for (although it&#x27;s possible it&#x27;s a useful proxy).",1427014365

Frankly, encasing scientific knowledge in papers is now beyond a joke. Why we are still relying on parchment based technology and pre-enlightenment publishing norms drives me nuts. Examples:<p>1. Genomics papers that have a table with thousands of rows printed in a PDF in the appendix. Almost willfully annoying.<p>2. Two page papers in top life sciences journals that have 100 page appendices which are not searchable or indexed.<p>3. Papers that are heavily criticised in letters, but none of this is obvious when looking at the original paper HTML page, the abstract or the PDF.<p>4. Long clinical trials that are published repeatedly over 20 years, where the previous interim data updates are locked away in journal archives that requires extra payment or a subscription to JSTOR.<p>5. Papers with 10 supplementary tables, all single file excel spreadsheets.<p>6. Papers are submitted for publication 12 months before they are actually published. Bad luck if you started working on the same thing 6 months ago.<p>7. If I want to show a table from your paper in a presentation, I have to manually snapshot from the PDF and paste it on my slide.<p>8. Because the only way to disseminate data is with a paper, important trial results can be given as a presentation at a conference, and not become available until published much later. Until then, the only record of these results are your memory if you were there, a pay-walled recording of the presentation, a drug company press release, or sandwiched between banner ads on a &#x27;medical news&#x27; site.<p>9. Old papers get ignored, because they just aren&#x27;t readily available. Life science researchers regularly &#x27;discover&#x27; something that was published in the 1970s.<p>10. It is impossible to read all these papers. One part of my research field easily has 10000 papers or more that could be justifiably relevant. Biology has now reached the absurd tipping point where it is easier and cheaper in terms of labour costs to do an experiment yourself rather than thoroughly survey the literature.<p>Hopefully computer science papers aren&#x27;t like this.<p>EDIT: grammar",1427012200

I&#x27;ve been observing this for quite a while and try to put my finger on where the problem is for Vancouver. Have been trying to talk to people up and down the coast who are similar as well to understand more.<p>It&#x27;s a complex comparison because:<p>- SF has crazy amount of capital flowing around, people are earning crazy $, but there&#x27;s also high cost of living and tax rate<p>- Seattle is not as crazy as SF, but still has plenty of high paying engineers. Cost of living is quickly rising. Locally, it&#x27;s starting to become a problem in some areas like Capitol Hill, like SF&#x27;s Mission area. However, WA don&#x27;t have personal income tax. So while on paper we don&#x27;t make more than we do in SF. The general consensus from those that made the move north from SF says they end up keeping more.<p>- Vancouver doesn&#x27;t have crazy tech capital. But it&#x27;s got a really nice environment. Has public health care whereas in the States we have to account for health care cost. Generally American tech jobs provide health care with co-pay/deductible options but it&#x27;s still thousands out of pocket before the 100% insurance coverage kicks in.<p>The Canadian brain drain thing has always happened since early 2000. I think the biggest problem with Vancouver is that there isn&#x27;t enough venture capital flowing in. In many places where there doesn&#x27;t exist an already established tech scene, like Detroit, the government has a lot of subsidies for companies to move there. However, there doesn&#x27;t seem to be enough or any for companies that want to move to Vancouver. In fact, many of our subsidies are starting to expire, and that&#x27;s why many gaming and SFX studios are shutting down. Without the much needed capitals, start-ups have harder time competing with Seattle and SF which offer comparable/better climate and surrounding with much better pay. Often time when I hear a Vancouver company pitch it&#x27;s by saying how nice and active the city is. Sure, the city is nice but is it worth the difference in pay? To me, at least not at this point. Not at least with the money I am making I can afford to come back whenever, or fly down to SF for a few days.
