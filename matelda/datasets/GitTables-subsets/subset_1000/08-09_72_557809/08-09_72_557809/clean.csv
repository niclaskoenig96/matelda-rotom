All of the code base contains zero lines of Javascript - it is all regular Java classes.",1245746775
670014,comment,669231,669231,0,0,kenver,,,"Once again, and this story is yet another example, poorly implemented DRM frustrates and alienates legitimate users, and doesn't do anything to stop a determined pirate who will almost always find a way to overcome the DRM.<p>The best DRM I've ever experienced is Steam, it takes away your ability to resell games, but gives you quite a lot of features in return.  In fact until it was pointed out to me on HN some time ago, I didn't even notice that it was a form of DRM because it never gets in my way.",1245746497

I care about the boring life-y bits from people I know but not from people I follow because they have done cool things professionally.<p>But honestly the voting burden is too high to make it work I think. Also, I really wish things were like the 2ch/4chan model, where I could evaluate the quality of content on its own merits instead of on who said it. But that might just be too much.",1245744983

There is much to discuss about Apple and its products that's relevant to Hacker News. But getting notified about a firmware update that affects a tiny portion of readers isn't. I do not come to Hacker News to get stories about extremely niche hardware issues and fixes. I do not want to see the front page littered with stories <i>of this type</i>.<p>That ""a portion"" of HN readers found something relevant means nothing with respect to its appropriateness for HN. All of us have many interests and concerns which are not relevant to HN. When we start loading this site with anything and everything of tangential interest to any reader, the primary value of this site as a source for news about hacking and startups diminishes.",1245744332
