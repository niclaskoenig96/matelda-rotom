People are incredibly interested and open to technology and that is an opportunity.<p>HN probably has a thousand joking references to calculator watches of the 90s, how goofy they looked and how they marked you as chronically uncool. There&#x27;s something to that. Sensibilities have changed and there is an expectation that gadgets will evolve and unlock all sorts of cool magic. People are so open to this stuff today.<p>My reading of these bands/watches/wearables is that they&#x27;re still exploring. They&#x27;re not getting enough data passively and they aren&#x27;t really working to the point where they&#x27;re a permanent addition our lives. Basically, not good enough yet. Maybe they need 10X better battery life. Maybe they need better sensors or somesuch. Maybe it&#x27;s a killer app they need. I just see around me people buying one, playing with it for weeks or months and then not using it anymore.<p>Either way, device makers are being tossed a soft ball by consumers. They&#x27;re willing to buy and try them and help explore. I hope this means they&#x27;ll get someplace useful. But, people are ultimately fickle and these need to start delivering fast. I hope this isn&#x27;t a misfire, too early to really achieve something.",1414663192

I&#x27;ve found serious XSS bugs in frameworks that are semi-popular for writing real-time applications with a web component. What&#x27;s outputted from your Markdown converter is generally assumed to be trusted HTML. Additionally, if it&#x27;s not written in a language with good string support... it has string processing, which could lead to a crash or buffer overflow easily. It seems that a Markdown converter is exactly the sort of place you&#x27;d be likely to find an attack vector.",1414663136

Compared to that doing a startup on an open source stack using dedicated machines <i>eventually</i> turns out much cheaper. It&#x27;s like getting hooked on drugs.<p>The most cost effective way as far as I can see is to hire a sysadmin on a freelance basis until you need one full time, own your own hardware (or lease it by the month until you can afford your own hardware) and pay flat rate for bandwidth. Anything else will sooner or later come to haunt you and then you will need to migrate to some new platform.
