Radiated water still leaks from the reactors and flows into the ground and the sea - how and when those leaks can be plugged is yet unknown. Nobody has any idea how to treat the huge volumes of radiated water that have been captured so far.<p>Cleanup costs and storage/disposal costs for the nuclear waste are usually also ignored when looking at the costs of nuclear power - as well as the environmental impact of mining uranium.

This doesn't surprise me, as both languages places a strong emphasis on the type system, and so they are easily supported.<p>Option types need no type system support beyond having option types at all. Think of an option type as a container. It's either empty, or it has a single element inside it.<p>You can manipulate your container by checking if it's empty, getting the value out, manipulating the value and putting the value in a new collection. That's the basic low-level primitives of interacting with an option type.<p>And you can also use higher-order operations, e.g. map over the collection which will only ""do things"" if there's a value and will just return an empty collection if there isn't. These are the higher-level combinators on option types. They require no type system complexity outside of having option types in the first place.",1370423925

5824410,comment,5823952,5824138,1,0,Peroni,,,"All solid advice.<p>I'd like to add to it with some absolute basics:<p>1. Avoid sounding scripted at all costs. I'm sure you'd be more comfortable practicing a certain pitch but a rehearsed script is obvious to everyone in the room. Sounding natural, confident and passionate is absolutely critical.<p>2. Stay honest. No product or service is perfect. Don't make excuses if someone attempts to pick holes in your product. Acknowledge it, thank them for the feedback and move on.<p>3. Be persistent. The hardest part of selling is picking yourself up and doing better the next time after being rejected over and over again.",1370423092

The investor gets up to their money back (1x preference), and no more.<p>If they choose to participate pro-rated they convert to common first, and participate equally with everyone, without the preference.<p>The investor would chose to convert to common when the sale price is greater than the post-money valuation of the deal. On this basis their pro-rated participation will be greater than the amount invested.<p>If the sale price is less than the post-money valuation of the deal, they would be sensible to keep their preferred stock, and exercise their 1x preference, meaning they get their original amount back 100 cents on the dollar.  The remaining is then split between the common shareholders proportionally (in effect without the dilution from the investor that exercised their preference).<p>Mark Suster (@msuster) from GRP put together a good spreadsheet [1] that shows the preference effect on sale, including preferred non-participating stock and preferred-participating (PP) stock (essentially double dipping into sale proceeds).<p>Brad Feld (@bfeld) from Foundry Group has a good write up of the different types of participation on his blog [2].<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.docstoc.com/docs/47831420/Venture-Capital-Valuation-Spreadsheet"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.docstoc.com/docs/47831420/Venture-Capital-Valuati...</a>\n[2]: <a href=""http://www.feld.com/wp/archives/2005/01/term-sheet-liquidation-preference.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.feld.com/wp/archives/2005/01/term-sheet-liquidati...</a>",1370422869
