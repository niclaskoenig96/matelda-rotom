7679093,comment,7678779,7678779,1,0,kapnobatairza,,,"I&#x27;m not convinced that income tax reform needs to be so radical. However, I am convinced by the first part of his reform which involves instituting a basic universal income. In my mind a basic income solves a few fundamental socio-economic problems:<p>1) Allows us to eliminate complex welfare and social security schemes, while providing food and life security for every citizen. You can&#x27;t eliminate all homelessness and poverty, but a basic income goes a long way towards eliminating most of it.<p>2) Drives development through increased mobility. People tend to cluster around areas where job availability is high leading to overcrowded cities with high real estate prices. A basic income provides the life security necessary to pursue living somewhere else, and will encourage people to move to &quot;cheaper&quot; areas where their basic income will go much further. Why live in NYC on your basic income when you could live in Kansas where your money goes a lot further? You&#x27;d instantly re-invigorate middle America and cities badly in need of urban renewal like Detroit.<p>3) Directly drives up GDP growth through increased consumption - Rather than flowing inflation through fed/bank lending or government spending, flow inflation bottom up through consumer spending.<p>4) Eliminates the economic paradox of sustaining human labour that can easily be mechanized.<p>5) A basic income is a cushion which creates an incentive towards higher-education and/or re-training and/or artistic/artisinal endeavours. Whichever country implements a basic income will cultivate the greatest scientific and artistic talent in the world.<p>I could go on but I&#x27;ll stop there.<p>I realize there are some strong counter arguments against the basic income, but most would simply argue that a basic income would have no real effect. Given the potential benefits of such a proposal, I think it&#x27;s an experiment worth trying. The potential pros are too numerous to list while the potential con is that it will be a complex poltical exercise that may have no effect.",1398941403

7679068,comment,7677898,7678583,4,0,dredmorbius,,,"I&#x27;m smelling a possible reboot of the browser paradigm.<p>There are a few fundamental uses I see, and they&#x27;re somewhat distinct:<p>• Reading.  For which stripping 99.99966% of Web formatting would be preferred.  If I got content-heavy sites in a form similar to what Readability, Pocket, Instapaper, etc., delivers, I&#x27;d be <i>much</i> happier.  Well, slightly less grumpy.  I found it interesting that the Kobo tablet was, for a while, advertising its browser as doing just that (from what I can tell of the revised copy, they&#x27;re offering built-in Pocket).  See:  <a href=""http://www.kobobooks.com/tablets"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kobobooks.com/tablets</a>  Online forums are another special case.<p>• Commerce.  Here authentication and payment are concerns.  Neither are built in to existing HTML standards.<p>• Applications. Something that&#x27;s more than just putting words (and images) on a page, or buying stuff.  For this I&#x27;m actually inclined to think that the Mobile app model might be more appropriate.  Say I want ... an email tool, or an interactive mapping tool, or a host monitoring solution, etc.  Running this in a separate process space, in a separate windowing context, individually controllable, etc., would be a huge win.<p>The other element is user state:  there are <i>very</i> few cases where I need a specific browser page <i>running</i> at all times (selected apps are the exception).  What I <i>do</i> want <i>is to be able to return to the page state I&#x27;d last left it at</i>.  With very aggressive paging out of state to local storage, and/or simply leaving a marker of &quot;this is where you were at&quot;, and being able to recall it as needed, overall performance would vastly improve.<p>Neither Firefox nor Chrome presently offers this.  On Firefox, there&#x27;s a single process space, such that <i>all</i> tabs become unresponsive when system resources are exhausted.  On Chrome, there are multiple subprocesses, which are individually much heavier-weight than Firefox&#x27;s own tabs, but which can be individually killed.  You have to reference them indirectly, however, through a task manager, rather than being able to simply kill the tab you&#x27;re on at the moment (you can <i>close</i> it, you cannot <i>kill</i> it).  In both cases I&#x27;m finding myself constantly manually managing resources.  I&#x27;ve also found myself abandoning Firefox for Chrome as with the former I&#x27;ve got to kill/restart the whole thing, while Chrome gives more granular control, and Chrome tends to crowd out FF for resources.  Both are very far from optimal.",1398940682

Goc is a simple preprocessor that allows writing C code with Go function declarations, and it will transform said code into C code compiled by 6c using some rules that are somewhat hard for people to do by hand and not screw up. For all practical purposes, goc is not required, people can write the C code by hand, it bears no effect on linking and on the ability to use code in external objects. Also, it&#x27;s seldom used, most of the code is C code, not touched by goc.<p>The Go linker does know how to link with external objects and use their symbols, and it does this without requiring the external object to be present at link time. It can do this, because the most basic relocations don&#x27;t require any knowledge about the object. This was previously supported only on PE-COFF, as it was previously used by the Windows target, but now I have extended it to ELF too, and it&#x27;s used on the Solaris target.

There&#x27;s a huge range of potential outcomes which different people might judge to be good, let&#x27;s not pretend that there is one objective outcome which equals better/success/good or that it is strictly linked with making something people think they want right now. You can also make something they will want in one year, or something they will want when everyone else wants it too, or something only a few want but which you feel everyone might want if only they are exposed to it in the right way.<p>You can certainly argue that Paper fails to appeal to its intended audience, or deal with the content they have, rather than the content they&#x27;d like to have, but part of delivering a successful product is shaping what your users want by delivering something you consider valuable, not entirely pandering to their existing expectations or taste. e.g. iphones vs existing phones, ipod versus CD players etc. so I imagine that was the motivation for it. The trap that FB finds itself in is that they have grown massive by pandering to the lowest common denominator, and now cannot escape that. Sticky content they may have, but how much of it is worth the pixels?<p>The article and your comment here are sliding from &#x27;better outcomes&#x27; to &#x27;number of downloads/users/views/likes&#x27; as a definition of better - there are other definitions of better/success/good and some of them even make money (see Apple&#x27;s attitude to design under Jobs). Things which are popular in a given era are rarely considered good or valuable in the long-term - popularity is an ephemeral and misleading measure of quality if you look at writing, design, art or any other creative field.",1398939857

7679019,comment,7675533,7675533,7,0,Udo,,,"Antibiotics are done, and they&#x27;ve been failing increasingly for at least two decades even though nobody cared to report it then. The speed of our transition to the &quot;post-antibiotics era&quot; is certainly our fault, but the phenomenon itself was always inevitable. Biology is an arms race, and it will always be one. In fact, biology overall is one of the worst substrates imaginable for hosting conscious entities, and that means this and many other problems may never be permanently solved.<p>However, it&#x27;s not all hopeless. There are a lot of bacterial infections that will continue to be treatable with antibiotics for some time to come. So it&#x27;s not like we&#x27;ll lose all of our capabilities at the same rate. It just means that gradually the number of strains that are panresistant will increase.<p>To see what complete powerlessness over an infectious agent looks like you don&#x27;t have to look further than viral infections today. The reality is we still can&#x27;t do very much to treat them, so over time we&#x27;ll just add significant bacterial adversaries to this list of diseases for which there is nothing else but symptomatic treatment available.<p>This will all change, because medicine has to change. In the future, it won&#x27;t be enough to hit an unspecific infection with an unspecific antibiotic. It will be necessary to analyze individual infections and their interactions with individual patients in detail - and then very specific biochemical treatments will have to be tailored on a case-by-case basis.<p>The recent rise of monoclonal antibody drugs is a bridge to that future. We&#x27;re still not knowledgeable enough, and we&#x27;re still using these treatments with all the finesse of a 3-year old hammering huge lego toys together, but we&#x27;ll get there eventually. We have to, it&#x27;s the only hope against a lot of other diseases as well, including cancer.<p>In the mean time, there is a lot of research that needs to be done. We&#x27;re also missing the actual technologies, both diagnostic and generative machines, but the most important obstacle to overcome will probably be the culture of medicine. This culture will change only when there is enough pressure for it to change. The FDA will have to change when its primary role becomes denying treatment to people who are going to die instead of keeping the population safe. Medical professionals will change when it becomes a big factor that they lack the scientific background to effectively devise and apply advanced treatments. But first, all of these disasters will probably have to actually happen, and we&#x27;re already seeing the first signs of that trend.<p>So, there is definitely a path forward - it&#x27;s not an inevitable descent into the dark ages. It&#x27;s just that due to inertia and time spent waiting for basic scientific advances, there will be a period with less protection overall. Drugs may become available to plug some of these gaps, like insect-derived antibiotics, which will eventually fail too but will buy some additional time.",1398939316
