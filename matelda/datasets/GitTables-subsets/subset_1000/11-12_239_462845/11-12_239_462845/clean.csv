4753081,comment,4752047,4752520,8,0,calibraxis,,,"I've seen many Black people made to feel inferior by comments like this, which have the result of implying that the reason they probably got in was because a ""superior"" student didn't. But for one thing, those of privileged races who didn't get in were obviously extremely marginal candidates anyway, who even failed to capitalize on their racial privileges.<p>(And of course, a Black individual who happens to agree with affirmative action is less likely to publicly offer their perspective here, since ironically doing so may hamper their careers, as some future investor or employer googles them. It's much safer to hold the ideology which appeals to these gatekeepers, regardless of skill.)<p>Those who are truly concerned about racism have different criticisms of the (mostly private) system of expensive elite universities, as well as the US imprisoning by far more of its population than any other country. Such things affect education far more than affirmative action ever has.<p>And there are different kinds of affirmative action programs, with different attributes.

If the confidence interval each poll is 4%, then the interval for a single poll is 4% / sqrt(44) = 0.6%, which is easily enough to make a confident forecast of an Obama victory in Ohio (my model was > 98% confident in its Ohio forecast).<p>In Alabama, the last poll was on Aug 16th, and it was 40% Obama, 60% Romney. Even with a margin of error of 4%, this state was clearly going to go to Romney (my model had 99.9% confidence in this forecast).<p>This pattern is repeated for almost every state - the states with few polls are not contested, and the hotly contested states are a focus for pollsters, so there are a lot of polls there.

4753049,comment,4752208,4752458,7,0,furyofantares,,,"Take Florida, for example.  He predicted a 50.3% chance of an Obama win.  If Romney actually wins it, he's only a little bit wrong - counting him as 0/1 on Florida in this case wouldn't be accurate.  If Obama wins it, he's only a little bit right - counting him as 1/1 on Florida here wouldn't be accurate.<p>It's hard to quantify just how close he was. I give him props because his prediction was that Florida was very close and that turned out to be true no matter which way the state actually ends up going in the final result.<p>Now take Virginia, which was one of the later states to be called.  He had Obama at 79.4% chance to win.  But it turned out to be reasonably close -- which makes me wonder if we really had enough data to justify such a large %.  It's a highly polled state, so maybe we did and we just came somewhat close to hitting that 20% of the time where all the polling was inaccurate.  Or maybe he had Obama's chances too high.<p>Another way to judge a prediction model like this is to credit him with .794/1 for Virginia, rather that 1/1.  For Florida he gets .503 if Obama wins, and .497 if Romney wins.  That doesn't capture it perfectly, either, but at least it doesn't give him 0/1 in Florida if Romney wins even though he successfully predicted that the state was super close.",1352288005

Also why have they got 2 automotive fuel filters on top of that tank of red stuff and why are the filters venting to the atmosphere?\nIsn't that wasting their precious hydrogen?\n6 hours of elecy from each litre of pee? I'm certain that if pushed I could generate about a litre an hour and thus this machine would power my pc , my router and charge my iPad for free.<p>Or not because this story is bullshit.\nSeems others think so too\n<a href=""http://nathan-lee.com/blog/2012/11/07/urine-powered-generator-theyre-taking-the-piss/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nathan-lee.com/blog/2012/11/07/urine-powered-generato...</a>",1352287139

If your product existed before their patent was filed, them filing a complaint essentially saying the two are similar could be used as evidence (within its self) that your product is prior art and have the patent invalidated.<p>But realistically patents are just a giant cash pissing contest where the two parties throw as much cash in each others direction as they can until one of them runs out of money.",1352286961
