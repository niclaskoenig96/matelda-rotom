If you're just starting off, and no-one knows about your brand, then you can just as easily switch to another branding.<p>The only reason you should pay lots for a domain name is if it's hard or impossible to switch. i.e. you're already invested in that brand.<p>For example, openstreetmap.org is basically ""doing to google maps what wikipedia did to encyclopedias"". They have been going for years, and have ~ 200,000 users. openstreetmapS.org (not the S) was squatted. They eventually raised funds and bought it.

There are ways to do scrolling, like clicking both buttons, but it doesn't seem to send all the scroll wheel events.  So I can't even find a way to get that version of the calendar to work.<p>An alternative to both might be to use a linear fisheye.  It would just need a selection for 31 days at the bottom, 12 months in the middle, and a few years at the top.

1249754,comment,1249539,1249539,0,0,jasonlotito,,,"Off-topic, but related to stuff mentioned in the article.<p>How do we relate the idea that we own the data a company like Visa collects about us?  For example, our buying habits should be ""our data.""  While I understand the need for privacy, people go on to worry about how Visa will use this information, and it's impact on privacy.<p>Does Visa have the right to use this data to target users?<p>On one hand, we'd be highly upset if Visa didn't use the data it collects in certain cases, like anti-fraud and tracking odd behavior and warning us of it.  But then you have an article like this asking for consumer protection.<p>I guess the issue here is one of balance: who owns the data? If it's the user, does the company really have the right to use that data to provide a service with it? Even if it's anti-fraud or simple customer service?  This isn't something new, either.  It's only become easier and easier to do more accurately as technology grows.<p>On one hand, privacy is important for obvious reasons.  On the other hand, generated data is useful and can be used for improving our lives.  Just as privacy protects the criminals as well as the innocent, generated data can be used for ill or for good.<p>I don't think I'm asking anything new.  I've always been a person that wants to track everything users do.  On sites I create, I want to track everything, know everything.  Yes, I want to do this so that I can increase profit.  But it's only because I believe that a user who attempts to make a purchase and fails really wanted the product, and it's my job to do everything in my power to get that product to him.  I have no desire to steal his data, sell his information, or anything else.  But I can see how something like this could be misrepresented or misused.<p>Just some thoughts I had on this.  I'd like to hear other points of view on both sides of the spectrum.  I admit I don't know enough, and while my motives are honest, they are in a way profit driven.  Customer services is profit driven (Apple doesn't provide the CS it does because it loses money on it!)!  And if anyone has any good links on the topic, please share.",1270732739

Are you sure that's what you want?<p>That is exactly what I want.<p>> How long do you think the copyright terms should be?<p>Personally I think 20 years is a reasonable number. The original Copyright Act of 1790 established a term of 14 years with the option of one renewal. Remember that this was in the age of manual printing presses and horse-drawn wagons. In this age of on-demand printing and digital distribution 20 years is more than enough.<p>The copyright system isn't a right in the sense of speech or assembly, it's a temporary monopoly granted to an author in order to ""..promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts.."". Any aspect of copyright law which fails to promote those goals fails to uphold the constitutional foundation and ultimate purpose of the copyright system.<p>Copyright law exists in order to encourage authors to create by allowing them to benefit from their creation, but how does allowing a person to collect royalties on something they made 50 years ago promote creativity?",1270731799
