2336064,comment,2335947,2335947,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"Please, please, please don't use the word ""bubble"". Ever. Even if there is a bubble going on, and there's definitely not right now, don't ever use that fucking word with regard to technology.<p>First of all, what we have now is something different. Getting venture capital is still <i>incredibly</i> difficult for most companies. As in, if you have a 4-person startup you'll probably have one or two people working full-time on the funding game, which puts significant drag on technical growth. Not fun. Moreover, most startups I know about describe a tension between true technical excellence (scaling, robustness, and correctness, all of which become critically important in the middle and end game) and chasing the more superficial features that appeal to VCs.<p>Facebook, along with a few other startups that have capitalized on this bizarre and silly ""social"" fad, is probably overvalued. Everyday startups are still severely undervalued. It's a different pattern than the one in the 1990s. In the 1990s, people were absurdly optimistic not only about technology, but about the economy and society as a whole. People actually believed, in 1999, that society had permanently transcended the idiocy (um, wrong!) that characterized the bulk of human economics and social relationships throughout history. They were loopy. In 2011, people are dismal and depressed and anxious and only a few of the perennial optimists are starting to perk up (they were always there, but people are now listening to them again; I have no idea whether that's a good or bad thing for peoples' money, but if it's good for smart people with ideas, we must encourage it).<p>Second, anything that pulls opportunity into the hands of the smart and ambitious, instead of the socially well-connected who usually monopolize it, must be encouraged, no matter what its financial implications are. Anything (except a war) that gives smart people a chance, which most of them haven't had for a very long time, must be encouraged.",1300370040

2336052,comment,2334170,2335463,0,0,sophacles,,,"When you have an expert parent (or other adult influence) you can, and frequently do, learn things in a ""weird"" order. Further study after study from teaching land shows that ""the natural order"" to learn things is not nearly as fixed as one would think, the order you learned in is not the only way. The order you were taught in is not the only alternative way.<p>I remember I started learning in C, reading security and working on perl all the same time. I didn't even know about SQL for a couple years after that. This was in the late 90's and early 00's tho, things were a bit different, but it isn't improbable nor impractical to have this learning curve in a semi-self taught way. It is even less improbably given that her dad probably taught what he knew best, C and Kernel stuff.<p>When I was a kid, my grandfather was an electrician. I grew up learning about house wiring, and how to do it properly and quickly.  I learned how to solder and do stuff with wires long before I ever did basic electronic theory stuff. It never occurred to me that 120VAC was any more dangerous than a small fire. Imagine my surprise when in college I first encountered these professors who were terrified of wall current ('of course it will hurt you, just don't be stupid' is still how i think of both fire and electricity, the stuff isn't magic). I was confused when we went over stupid ""this is how a dpdt switch works"" and annoyed that we never played with any circuits more advanced than I grew up doing for over a year. I had never had any basic electronic theory at that point.<p>So: do you disbelieve me because I didn't learn in some natural progression as an electrician apprentice would? Because I didn't learn in the order the courses laid out in college?<p>tl; dr -- the idea of a ""natural progression"" in learning is just bunk.",1300369812

That does nothing to help us make future decisions.<p>I think the focus on blame is a distraction from our understanding of the situation as a whole. The chain of causation never really ends.

How do you have to know anything about that functions implemantation.</i><p>Well. I need to know that it accepts two parameters, first being an integer, the second being an array of integers.<p>In an OOP solution this would at least be exposed by type signatures, something you don't always see in FP solutions (often due to type-inference). Hence you need to check the implementation.<p>And this is for a simple example. What about more complex example? Where the input-data has a more complex nature? Take the following example:<p><pre><code>    var data = [ { id: 1, value: 2 }, { id: 2, value: 3} ];\n    var ordered = orderByValue(data);\n</code></pre>\nIgnoring the ""var data =""-line: Without checking the implementation, how would you know how the input-data should be formatted? What types and properties are needed, and in what format the function accepts the data? A seq? A list? An object with properties? You don't.<p>In C# the same function would probably be contained in a relevant class and have a signature akin to the following:<p><pre><code>    IEnumerable<ValueHolder> OrderByValue(IEnumerable<ValueHolder> data)\n</code></pre>\nNow I <i>know</i> what it returns, what it expects and don't have to worry about that. The type-signature tells me everything. The types it expects tells me everything. Moreover, this is probably already implemented on a specialized collection class, so all I need to do is:<p><pre><code>    var data = new ValueHolderList();\n    // populate\n    var ordered = data.OrderByValue(); // notice -pure- implementation in OOP ;)\n</code></pre>\nAgain. The implementation tells me what I need to know. Details are blackboxed, abstracted and objects easy to work with. I don't have to worry about functions, context, what they expect and in which order the glue is expected. In FP you are more commonly exposed to the internals of things and need to figure these things out yourself.<p>I'm not saying I am 100% right and you are 100% wrong. I'm saying there is lots of grey here which this thread doesn't really seem to cover or acknowledge.<p>FP is not a silver-bullet and nor is OOP. FP has strengths. So does OOP. Lots of the ""weaknesses"" I see people complain about with regard to OOP here are what I consider weaknesses in FP and strengths of OOP.<p>I sometimes wonder if we are living on the same planet.",1300369059

It enables things like Structural interfaces (you implement what you implement) like in Go, instead of declarative interfaces (you implement what you say you implement) like in Java/C++/C#.<p>""Messaging"" and its loose coupling also means the ability of doing <i>Method Lookup Alteration and Interception</i> [1], such as those provided by Smalltalk’s doesNotUnderstand, Ruby’s missing_method and Python’s __gettattr__ method. This is crucial because it allows you to compose objects, as they are strippable down to the Common Lisp Object System system: an object is a function that takes a message specification (method name and args) and decides what to do with it.<p>Yeah. Messaging is really important and powerful. It also explains why Alan Kay also said: <i>I coined the term object-oriented, and C++ wasn't what I had in mind.</i><p>[1]<a href=""http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=2&ved=0CBsQFjAB&url=http%3A%2F%2Fciteseerx.ist.psu.edu%2Fviewdoc%2Fdownload%3Fdoi%3D10.1.1.91.1021%26rep%3Drep1%26type%3Dpdf&rct=j&q=method+lookup+alteration+and+interception&ei=ZSEsTMTYC4KJuAfw2p3CCQ&usg=AFQjCNH7dktUqD_4vSjR5aHidE9U4Y3sIg&sig2=bHOpRznFWe0WqxTJxx9D9w"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=2&v...</a>",1300368846
