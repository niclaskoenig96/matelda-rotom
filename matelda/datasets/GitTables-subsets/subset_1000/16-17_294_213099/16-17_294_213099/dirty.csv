Good luck doing that with GCO, PayPal, or AFPS.<p>Also, as Jamie said, they offer an API to query payment data; while this isn't an asynch API like what Google offers, it at least opens up the possibility of writing a batch process that reconciles data between your application and Braintree.<p>Overall BT has been very responsive to our needs and, as a result, I have recommended them to many of the YC Summer '08 companies, along with many other companies I've talked to outside of YC.",1225385841

Rejection is never pleasant, but the experience was positive overall and I take my hat off to Y Combinator for pioneering this unique approach to helping startups. I know other investors are watching closely and some are beginning to emulate them. All good. It would be most helpful if YC could provide statistical profiles of companies that applied and those that made it to the next round. Would also be interesting to know how many YC is planning to fund (given the current economic stituation.)",1225385785

One of the things that you forget about when you are a student is that professors love looking for real world examples that they can incorporate into their curriculum's and classrooms. I had professors, students, and even librarians helping me collect everything from incorporation papers to market research.  Eventually, as the company began moving a million miles a minute, I took a step back from my education and decided to get 'the baby out of the crib' before I return.<p>My point?  Utilize what you can from where you are... engage fellow classmates, professors, and faculty.  My number one suggestion is pull a professor aside and talk to him, can't hurt can it?<p>At the end of the day... everyone loves helping a student.",1225385720

348837,comment,348774,348774,0,0,gruseom,,,"It's hard to know how applicable my experiences are to your situation, but here are some things that I figured out (after a lot of time and frustration) that proved effective.<p>Grad school, for many people, seems inevitably to entail some prolonged dark night of the soul. Accept this as part of the process. It can cause you to lose yourself and your connection to what you really care about... or you can use it to strengthen these things. But you have to do that yourself. Don't expect anyone to help you. Models like ""a community of teachers and learners"" or ""a thriving research environment"" can lead to serious depression when they don't deliver. A better model is something like ""an odyssey of solitude to test you"".<p>I naively assumed that grad school would be an extrapolation of undergrad: I would be continuing my education by going deeply into a particular field. That was a big mistake. Eventually I realized it had nothing to do with education or even particularly with ideas. It was job training for becoming an academic. The real subject matter was: how to get an article published, how to fill out a grant application, how to give a talk at a conference. (Edit: oh, and how could I forget: how to pay as little attention to your teaching as possible.) As for learning the field, you were expected to know it all already and fill in any gaps on your own (we were handed a list of 500 books to read). I thought this was stupid and rebelled against the system in all kinds of ways that didn't help. Eventually I accepted that it is what it is, and turned my attention to what <i>I</i> wanted. Instead of changing the context, I figured out how to use it for my own purposes. It was hard to let go of my expectations - particularly to stop expecting mentorship or guidance from teachers. But doing so led to a lot of good things.<p>I divided my work into two categories: what I had to do to ""feed the animal"" (busywork and formal requirements) and what was meaningful to <i>me</i>. The strategy was to minimize the former (not eliminate it - don't fight the beast, petting works better) and maximize the latter. This worked well. Ironically, a lot of the praise and mentorship I had been craving started raining down on me once I no longer needed it.<p>Once one figures out how to feed the animal (in your case that sounds pretty easy), a graduate stipend can be a great basis for doing whatever you want. In my case, I used the last year of my fellowship to get back into programming. That was because I figured out I didn't want to stay in the field I was in; I had gotten what I needed out of it, and an academic job in that field would have been a waste. On the other hand, if I had had a passion for that field, I would have used my stipend to do work that I cared about, whether or not it was related to my official responsibilities. Not that I would have abrogated my responsibilities (that's the feeding the animal part) - just minimized them. If someone had asked me, ""Why are you doing this other stuff"" I would have said ""That's my side project"" or something like that. I also would have reached out to other people in the field, perhaps by sending them drafts of papers and so on. The point is that I would have done all this on my own and built up my own network of relationships.<p>This is a long comment that I could easily make longer! In any case, good luck.<p>Edit: ok, one more thing. It can be really useful to find a kindred spirit or two at your institution. They don't have to be in the same field. I would go exploring a little if I were you.",1225385574
348836,comment,348774,348774,0,0,crpatino,,,"hi, first post ever!<p>basically... what you have, sir, is a day job with low expectations and no IP ownership conflict of interests. Please don't waste this opportunity. Of course you have to keep delivering value to the project, but if you are disciplined you can be done by lunchtime and devote the rest of the day to your own pursuits.<p>When you get a corporate job, you will feel the same. But then, you will have to moonlight and be careful not to use your employer resources (including IP and other intangibles). In the worst case, you will have to pick different domain and technology stack to avoid the illusion of IP theft.<p>If you endure in grad school, you might get your credentials and eventually decide what to work on... or you might not. But in any case, you don't need a paper that says you can solve complex problems. Read Paul Graham's article on Insiders vs Outsiders.<p>Good luck!",1225385536

348834,comment,348774,348774,0,0,gz,,,"A year is hardly enough time to gain perspective on grad school. Give yourself some time. Eventually you will find a research project that interests you. In the meantime I'd suggest you continue cultivating inter-departmental relationships, eg, by working on the project you mentioned.<p>Also, worth noting, most people find the first couple of years of grad school the most frustrating because they don't align with their expectations. Once you are past that and you have a well defined research project things get better. Finally, regarding ""finding elegant solutions to difficult problems that have wide-reaching implications"": you'd be surprised to discover that incremental work can also be elegant and make an impact. Especially is CS that's how most research is done. So, don't set yourself up for disappointment. Pick a small problem that interests you and start reading on it...<p>Good luck.",1225385363

They really feel like something from a 1950s sci-fi space comic. I don't believe I've used one in five years, at least.<p>The problems with checks are the same as the problems with credit cards -- the system is secure enough that the bank system is happier to buy down the losses/inefficiencies than to build an infrastructure secure and flexible enough to remove them. Since customers don't want to pay anything -- be it money or convenience -- to get additional security, the banks are on their own to improve things.

348823,comment,348774,348774,0,0,dhbradshaw,,,"This post is important and I think that your feelings echo those of many thousands of graduate students.<p>Let me talk a little bit as a rare case: I've worked now under 7 advisors on 7 different projects and now I'm finally almost done.  Most of the projects have been as you describe: ""after almost a year, it is fair to say that I have good view of the project and it is almost surely a giant failure.""<p>That's how most projects are.  I'm not sure why, but I think it has to do with the fact that the projects are ""planned research.""  The process of getting funding requires planning something that is intrinsically impossible to plan.  You write a grant on hope, with the large picture in mind and then you get down to the details and things don't work out.  This is normal.*  Especially on the time frame of a new graduate student, it seems terrible.<p>To some extent, though, the system works.  It does so for the same reason that some startups work: because as you look at the details you find new things that you couldn't have predicted.  Those new things are your research.  I'm working on a ""failed project.""  But after 1.5 years working on it I am ready to begin writing a dissertation that I am proud of.  Why?  Because I found neat things along the way.  That's how it works.<p>If you are in a good lab and surrounded by good people, I would recommend that you don't focus as much on the larger project as on learning all you can from the people around you and on understanding the details that your project will lead you to focus on.  It is in helping other people, tracking down details, and playing with interesting questions that you will find the great science, not directly through the success of the larger project.<p>By the time I finish, I will have learned a lot.  But I will have spent almost 8 years in graduate school, 2 for a masters in one field and almost 6 for a PhD in another field.  If I had had my current perspective from the beginning I would have been a little more patient and I might thereby have saved myself three years.   So there is a cost to hopping around even if there are benefits in terms of perspective.<p>Best wishes.<p>*I know of one exception.  He explained his system: he does the research, then he gets grants for his research.  This gives him time to do new research and he writes new grants based on that.  He delivers because he only proposes to do what he has already more or less done!",1225384812
