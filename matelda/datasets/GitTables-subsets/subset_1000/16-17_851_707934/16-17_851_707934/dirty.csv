The introduction of a databases nearly always more than doubles the complexity of a program and the amount of code written.  There's a reason developers like in memory prototypes and persistent hash tables, they require less code than any other solution and don't force you to tear apart your model and try and stuff it into tables and put it back together again on every page view.",1247245158

It was a money loser for Redfin - first offer fell through due to misrepresentation by the purchaser, second one was complicated due to an extremely picky purchaser, and it took a total of about 60 hours of work by the Redfin agent to get the deal closed. It was an unusual case but the point is i've done about 4 other transactions and this was the most professional and hardest working agent and it was the cheapest... So they don't drop you if your transaction turns out to be a statistical outlier... HIGHLY recommended.",1247245154

Play it in English and then switch over to French and join a guild. A couple reasons why I though this could work:<p>-Because the context is limited, you should be able to intuit more meaning on your own in much the same way that people learn languages from birth.<p>-You can start with written words and move up to spoken language (Teamspeak, ventrillo, etc.)<p>-You are subverting the carefully designed rewards placed in all MMO's for your own needs. -the better you know the language, the better you can play, and the better you will be rewarded.<p>Possible downsides - a lot of the language will be slang, or be particular to the game itself.",1247245150

Relational databases are never the fastest option, they are the safe conservative option.<p>The bill of goods that RDBM's sell is that data integrity trumps all else.  The reality is that is doesn't.  Data can be cleaned and integrity maintained by background processes if the performance you get is more important to you than absolute up to the second data integrity.  There are lots of cases where available data is far more important than up to the second accurate data.<p>Eventual consistency is more than good enough for many many things common web applications do.

I already know several programming languages and have no problem picking more up in a short time(picking up as in understand and write the syntax. ""Learning"" a language actually takes a long time).  English is a second language to me(Arabic is the native one).<p>Now I'd like learn French to be able to converse in. Any helpful pointers?",1247241828

Why would anyone click on a text based ad which distracts them from the video they want to watch. I don't see why anyone would voluntarily do that. At some point google is going to have to bite the bullet and have video ads. Even if they are on after a video is shown they would be far more effective and desirable for advertisers.",1247241767
