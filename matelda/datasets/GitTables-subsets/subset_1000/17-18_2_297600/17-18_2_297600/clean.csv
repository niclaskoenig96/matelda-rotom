6081,comment,5987,6075,0,0,domp,,,"I'm not buying the telecocooning thing. Sounds like more of a catch phrase more than anything else. I can put up an away message that says whatever I'm doing much like a ""presence poke"". Or I can just blast a text to my friends letting them know what meaningless task I'm involved in at the moment. <p>I can see how it can show how you care or are thinking of them but if telecocooning lowers the barrier doesn't that trivialize a message? It's like giving a myspace bulletin to your whole friends list but telling them something less important than what is usually sent around.<p>I do like that you can use it to meet up with friends. That's a cool feature.",1174755801
