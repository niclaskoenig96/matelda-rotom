The patent system in our country is so insane and out-of-control, it's unwise for a corporation to act as if it isn't.<p>There are lawsuits flying every which way over absurd things the patent office has granted patents for - so if you hold the patent for something ridiculous and widespread, you not only prevent someone else from getting it and suing you, but it's a bargaining chip when someone comes at you with another patent violation. They say ""we'll sue you because we hold the patent on 'an electronic way to display text'"" and you say ""if you do that, we'll sue you because we hold a patent on 'a tactile alphanumeric input device.'"" And so instead of a costly legal battle, you've won yourself a stalemate, with only the price of a few patent applications.<p>Not to say that this is an appropriate way for the system to function, and not that big companies shouldn't be lobbying to fix the patent system (I believe some of them are), but I feel like M$ is just playing the hardball they need to play to protect themselves.",1258656593
950786,comment,950358,950617,0,0,bwhite,,,"The problem is that the incentives are all wrong.<p>The air traffic controllers represent a significant problem. The original union (since busted by Reagan) had an incentive to reduce work and increase pay, so they established  conservative air separation rules, frequently made them even more conservative, and had regular slow-works. The union had an obvious incentive to fight against automation, too. (The current union isn't quite as bad. The incentives are the same, though.)<p>The USGOV has no obvious incentive to make the skies better. When flights go bad the people rail against the airlines, not the Feds. They also have the incentive to poorly fund the ATC system and use the money on other things that will give them more visible wins.<p>The airlines would like to upgrade their fleet but that's useless without ATC systems that can handle the new tech (like GPS). UPS finally bit the bullet and upgraded its planes and then paid for its main airport (in Kentucky) to be upgraded. I believe FedEx did the same (but in Tennessee).<p>A for-profit ATC system that was funded by mandated-minimum contributions from both general aviation and the airlines (both are already dinged to partially pay for the current ATC) would align the incentives properly. The airlines would be able to get more planes in the sky, packed tighter, and in more lanes. As new technology became available, they would use it. People would have much better flight experiences with fewer delays. USGOV would get to stop funding obsolete programs. And above all, the ATC company would have its incentives aligned with both the airlines and the people, since they'd get paid more if more flights were on time, etc. And the contract could be re-bid out every few years to ensure that the ATC firm doesn't let complacency reign.",1258656432

One of my primary reasons for creating jQuery was to develop a library that had very little syntactical overhead. This jQuery^2 experiment was trying to take it to the next extreme (almost no syntax, just some whitespace). To do this I built a very-hacky parser and search through the page for scripts that have a type of ""text/jquery"".<p>You'll note that the script that runs the page is actually in this meta-language. Also note that the code in the textarea compiles to some nonsense that doesn't actually run on that page. I was mostly just throwing in code to test the parser.<p>Projects like Cappuccino have taken this idea to the extreme and developed complete languages on top of JavaScript that are much more functional than what I present here.<p>Glad people are finding it to be interesting, though!",1258655102

I'm not an economist but how long can they keep doing this?
