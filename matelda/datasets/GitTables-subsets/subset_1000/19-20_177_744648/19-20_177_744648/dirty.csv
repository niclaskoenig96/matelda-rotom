There's a huge difference between not knowing why you might want to keep a binary tree balanced and not knowing how red/black trees work off the top of your head.  If you've heard of them and know what they're good for, you can look them up in a few seconds when you need them.<p>Of course, a talented hacker will know the details of <i>some</i> data structures and algorithms.  I'd be far more impressed with a candidate who could tell me in detail about recent uses of a couple more unusual data structures and algorithms than with a candidate who knew all the classics in detail but nothing unusual.",1205438347

136223,comment,136067,136067,0,0,dusklight,,,"Beyond technical skills, there are also people skills:<p>1. People make bugs, you make bugs. Playing the blame game is not productive, even if and especially when it really is the other guy's fault. Learning how to be diplomatic is important.<p>2. Big companies like to pretend that we are machines, but we are not. Be aware that your coworkers have egos, feelings and emotions, and they do not behave like machines. Machines don't try to hide their bugs instead of fixing them because they don't want to look incompetent, for example. Machines won't get hostile and obstructive if you don't like talking about their pet dogs during lunchtime.<p>3. The interests of the company are not always or not ever aligned with your own self interest. If you do good work but your boss doesn't know about it, it's like you didn't do it. A good manager will reward you fairly for working harder. Don't accept pats on the back or ""employee of the month"" awards for unpaid overtime. Only accept substantive incentives, like larger bonuses or faster promotions, etc.<p>4. A lot of times there are genuine incentives for an employee to intentionally write obfuscated code -- it makes it more expensive for the company to fire her. You just have to deal with it, and recognize that you should also have some similar kind of leverage with the company.",1205438219

136198,comment,131942,133144,0,0,curi,,,"First a note about ignorance, because I've sometimes had conversations with a somewhat opposite claim. People say things like, ""We agree children have great ignorance. This sometimes causes disagreements when they don't know the answer to something, but think they do. And children can be very stubborn, so in those cases their ignorance requires that we force them to the right decision."" Here rather than figuring that if the only thing present is ignorance there will be no problems, they have said that ignorance causes problems. And in particular, ignorance can cause a child to stubbornly disagree on a subject he knows little about. This is false, and perhaps important to how I see these issues. If a child thinks he knows enough to comment about something, let alone to be stubborn, that is not a matter of ignorance, that is an idea he has.<p>In fact, a lot of beliefs on parenting amount to trying to say both, ""Children are so ignorant and gullible that they'll believe almost anything. They pick up bad ideas very easily."" And, ""Children are so stubborn that they never listen to my good ideas."" But you can't have it both ways. If a child can pick up ideas causing him to disagree with his parent, there have also been opportunities for him to be persuaded of ideas in agreement with his parent. The parent is blaming his ideas' lack of appeal on the child's stubbornness, while denying the appeal of rival ideas based on the child's gullibility.<p>Here we have a different issue. We accept (or I do, and I'm clarifying, and if you don't we should probably discuss that) that ignorance is nothing to fear (indeed people face it all the time when exploring a new field.) And we further accept that ideas that are part of a truth seeking process are nothing to fear. Those will be amenable to criticism, improvement, persuasion. But what if a person has thoughts or preferences that are very unreasonable, or not even intended to be reasonable, or not created via a rational process? I will answer each of these cases separately.<p>'Very unreasonable' ideas are nothing more than ideas that the speaker strongly disagrees with. This isn't actually a comment on whether the process behind them is truth seeking, or whether they are held open to change.<p>Ideas that aren't intended to be reasonable are harder to address. But people aren't perfectly consistent, so sometimes it doesn't turn out to be much of a problem. Just because someone's philosophy isn't compatible with taking advice for good reasons (they deny their being such thing as truer reasons, say) doesn't mean they won't sometimes take your advice.<p>But if it is a problem, then we can focus on something else: why doesn't this person intend to be reasonable? He has a bad idea about how to approach life. He has little or mistaken understanding of what approaches will solve his problems, or will be enjoyable. Many people have an idea something like, ""arguments are unpleasant"" and avoid them. They can be! But there are ways of thinking and arguing which make them pleasant and helpful. One could begin by teaching/explaining those, and then the person could try using reason, find it's a good thing, and then intend to have reasonable ideas and make some effort to hold his ideas open to rational improvement. There is a rational path forward.<p>(Note for upcoming paragraph: By 'knowledge' I do <i>not</i> mean justified, true belief. What I mean is closer to 'understanding' or 'good ideas'.)<p>What about ideas that aren't created via a rational process? Well, like what? All knowledge is created via conjectures and criticism, aka evolution. If you actually left out criticism entirely it wouldn't be possible to get anywhere: very bad guesses would run amuck. You might think that some people are a bit like that. But that would underestimate how difficult daily life is. For example, having a conversation about the weather in English requires rational processes. You have to make guesses about whether the other person is talking to you, and what he means to say, and you have to criticize those guesses. If you don't, you won't create knowledge. In particular, you won't create knowledge of what he's trying to communicate. You won't understand and won't be able to reply coherently. Forming your own sentences is also a matter of knowledge creation. You must create knowledge of which words would express your intended meaning (not to mention what intended meanings should be said or not).<p>These conjectures and refutations that create knowledge mostly take place at a sub-conscious level. But we know they must be taking place or people would not be able to function at all for practical tasks or simple conversations. Whether there is a different way of creating knowledge is another can of worms, which we can discuss if you'd like, but I'll omit it for now.<p>The reason I went through each case of, ""what if a person has thoughts or preferences that are very unreasonable, or not even intended to be reasonable, or not created via a rational process?"" separately is that they are actually distinct claims. They are intended to be roughly synonymous descriptions of <i>something</i>, but they aren't. The question contains misconceptions about the types of situations it is intending to describe. When what's going wrong in each situation is understood more precisely, then it's easier to address.<p>We may still be wondering about those times people seem very unreasonable, agree they were unreasonable afterwards, and do intend to be truth seeking and rational. What could be going on there if they are, at least subconsciously, thinking with rational, knowledge-creating processes?<p>Part of the answer is that people make mistakes.<p>Part is that people generally have mistakes in their ideas about what their personality and ideas are. One consequences is that many mistaken ideas they ""used to have"" are actually still in their personality, but they don't realize it.<p>Part is memes, which really needs a separate post as well as a note that I think most published ideas about memes are terrible, so this may not be what you expect.<p>I'll stop here for now. Let me know what you think. No hurry.<p>PS I've bookmarked this thread and will check periodically unless you want to suggest another approach.",1205436053

It won't take more than an afternoon or two if you've done as well in all your CS classes as you say.  (One thing you might like to do after that is go back and look at the twisting road the Subversion guys went down as they implemented their DeltaV protocol -- considering that these are old Apache developers, it's enlightening to see that they followed plenty of dead ends, too)  For extra value, do it on an embedded system, with its totally different constraints.
