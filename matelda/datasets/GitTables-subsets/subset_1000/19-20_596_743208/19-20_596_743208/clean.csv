They started doing that last year when the price of their products started being more than competitors. The increased price of Prime was acceptable to me, but when I can go to a local store and purchase the items for cheaper, then that&#x27;s the price increase that I do not want.

The immutability is already implied by the &#x27;let&#x27; and &#x27;var&#x27;.<p>Additionally, specifying that the RValue &quot;[1,2]&quot; has mutability is meaningless. The expression &quot;[1,2]&quot; is represented as a constant until it is stored in a variable (it should be represented in the MACH-O constant data section). It is the variable which has the concept of mutability.<p>The proposal is similar to proposing the following declaration in C:<p>&quot;int i = const 1;&quot;<p>Which is meaningless, because the &#x27;1&#x27; can never be not-const",1405280945

It&#x27;s been about 10 years since I&#x27;ve coded in a C-style language (Java, C#, C++), but I&#x27;m very familiar with significant-whitespace languages (Python, Haskell, Coffeescript).  The C-style-ish-ness of Rust has colored my perception of the language: the features sound great... but it looks like C?  Admittedly, an unfortunately shallow perspective, but we&#x27;ve all got a lot of ground to cover and the view from 10km is necessarily incomplete.<p>The article&#x27;s side-by-side examples really opened my eyes.  I understand that Rust doesn&#x27;t implement all of the functionality of Haskell, but it&#x27;s comforting to see analogous functionality.  So Traits aren&#x27;t Type Classes; but as a beginner in Rust and as a first-order approximation, I can hear sorta-Type-Classes when I see Traits.  That&#x27;ll get me past the first steps, then I can dig into the detail of Traits.<p>I would suggest the author include a section on Side Effects since that&#x27;s a big talking point around functional languages.  Some allow them pretty freely (Ocaml) and some don&#x27;t (Haskell).

8028310,comment,8024449,8025730,1,0,hibikir,,,"Monsanto is now a relatively focused company that mostly sells seeds: Many GMOs, some bred traditionally. They also now sell some services related to optimizing seed selection for a particular field. If you read their PR(which you might believe or not), there is much focus on minimizing pesticide application, and instead make the plants themselves more resistant to pests. So instead of spraying your field with a liquid full of Bacillus Thuringiensis, they&#x27;d rather have the farmer grow plants with leaves that produce the same toxins than BT does.<p>The market cap is just 63B. In comparison, a Walmart is 240+. The main reason they are smaller than their competitors is that they separated their biotech arm from their chemical company roots, while most of their competitors are still mainly chemical companies: BASF and DuPont. If we just compared their seed-producing operations though, Monsanto is probably larger, but it&#x27;s not as if I&#x27;ve checked the numbers.<p>The thing about political influence is that it&#x27;s not really about size, but about being in a position so that you do not have clear opponents. Farmers as a whole do not dislike Monsanto, or they&#x27;d not buy their seeds. They tend to lower crop prices, so it&#x27;s not as if the next level in the food production chain has a problem with them either. So, as far as getting laws that are helpful to them, their one opponent is certain kinds of environmentalists. It&#x27;s how lobbying works: It&#x27;s easier to get a few people to spend a lot of an effort than to get a whole lot of people to do very little.",1405278797

The point is.. the chemical in the article was introduced because it is LESS harmful than it&#x27;s predecessors (DDT for example). I agree, probably more complete and broader scope research needs to be done before releasing chemicals (and drugs as well for that matter), but with technology you don&#x27;t always get everything right the first time. Believe me.. farmers don&#x27;t want to spend any money they don&#x27;t have to. And I highly doubt Monsanto and friends are out to enslave and poison the world. They are simply producing a product that there is a need for.<p>There is a level of negative impact we have to accept if we are going to have this many people on the planet. I would note... the chemicals that make your computer monitor colored, the fuels that run your car and heat your home, the production and use of those has severe environmental impacts as well.... much more persistent and severe than neonicotinoids. Short of reducing population or living standards, we are stuck moving forward and cannot go back. So there are impacts yes... we have to work to minimize them, and maybe we should do more, but doing things like calling for an all out ban on all pesticides is unrealistic. Are we willing to accept the death of millions of people due to rising food prices and starvation over the deaths of several species of birds and bees? I don&#x27;t think we are (well...maybe some of us are and maybe we should, but that&#x27;s a different topic).<p>My point is... all pesticides cannot be lumped together. They aren&#x27;t all the same. We need to do the best we can and maybe that is better than we are currently doing. But we are going to need pesticides. They aren&#x27;t bad. It isn&#x27;t a conspiracy. I don&#x27;t think a company presenting it&#x27;s supporting research when their chemical comes into question is &quot;suppressing&quot;. I appreciate they need to do this. I might add... you can&#x27;t always get good information from journalists and people who write sensationalist books about the BIG AG CONSPIRACY!.  Maybe there does need to be more regulation of big companies, some of them are abusive of the environment and humanity in general, this isn&#x27;t confined to ag companies... it is a pertinent topic and I don&#x27;t disagree with you on that.<p>People really are trying to work on the problem, generally keeping the needs of people to eat as first priority.

You might get a different answer depending if they were afraid of repercussion if they seemed irreverent  and didn&#x27;t say &quot;It is a symbol of Chairman Mao&#x27;s Love or something.<p>One can draw a parallel here with cargo cult followers of technologies (frameworks, langauges, api, operation systems, products) and so on. When someone decides to  pick a technology and you ask them &quot;why did you pick this framework?&quot; or &quot;what made you want to learn that language?&quot; you can learn quite bit by how they answer. Quite often you&#x27;ll find they don&#x27;t understand how basics work and you find out they picked it because it a cargo cult. They start repeating &quot;canned&quot; phrases they heard like &quot;it is webscale&quot; or &quot;it is non-blocking so it is better&quot;. Or they say &quot;this is slow&quot; and &quot;this is fast&quot;. And you ask &quot;have you measured, how did you measure?&quot;. And they haven&#x27;t, they just repeat something a friend with a cool shoes and haircut told them.<p>Cargo cult and hype following is not always black and white. I can see some validity at least on saying &quot;a big company is sponsoring this toolkit, so I&#x27;ll pick it because it will probably have enough ecosystem support to move forward&quot;. They might not understand the advantages or trade-offs so they use a heuristic. It is not bad, but it tells you something about the person, too.",1405278058

Computers are heading from becoming tools to appliances and circuits. You&#x27;ll never interact with most of them directly, and when you do, it&#x27;ll be through an abstracted shell or interface of some sort. The actual internals will be arcane to most, running some form of Contiki, QNX, specifically tailored variant of embedded Linux, or whatnot.<p>We&#x27;re already seeing this happen with smartphones and tablets. They offer an ecosystem of applications and network-enabled technologies that are useful to users, but in the end, they&#x27;re digital handcuffs.<p>The practical benefits of teaching programming will be outweighed by the sheer incompetence and farcical mess that compromises public education in general. There&#x27;s no way I, personally, can trust such a system to make anything worthwhile of this.",1405278046

Period.  That is the law.<p>The fact that the appearance of Amazon allowed millions of people to break that law when the local businesses <i>could not</i> is why the states went after Amazon directly.<p>Would you much rather that we start convicting people for not paying sales tax?
