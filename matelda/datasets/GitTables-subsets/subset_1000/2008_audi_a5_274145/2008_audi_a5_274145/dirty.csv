4.625,Sexy,tgeorge ,08/26/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,3,5,"By far the sexiest car in 2008 and 2 years later still holding its sex appeal. Fun to drive, ahead of the design curve. Turns heads like Kim Kardashians backside.  The six speed manual has some punch, especially in 2nd and 4th gear at the right speed and RPM. The 19 wheels are sporty yet classy and often get mistaken for aftermarket wheels. The most impressive design feature is the cars stance. There is little overhang, fine European lines and the stance of a muscle car, simply beautiful. ","Huge panoramic sunroof, LED driving lights, and brake assist is brilliant for city hills.",Panoramic sunroof only flips up. Make the B&O sound standard. 
4.75,"If Steve Jobs makes cars, it would be A5",Darth Vader ,02/19/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,5,"I am an ""early adopter"" of the A5 in early 2008.  After nearly a year of ownership, the car is holding up well.  I have had no mechanical problems except a burned-out LED light that was replaced and have noticed no rattles in the car after 12,000 miles.","Enduring sheet metal, fit and finish. Mechanically sound with good reliability.",None yet. 
4.875,A driver's car,Kent ,11/09/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"The Audi A5 is a terrific diver's car. While I would prefer a little more horsepower, I love the way the car handles the road.  The nav sys needs to be updated, but other than that, the interior of the vehicle is first rate.    ",B & O audio system.,Rear seat leg room is a little tight.
5,My 3rd Audi - and the best yet,Dave Q ,10/07/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"This is my 3rd Audi and to say that I am sold on the brand is an understatement! I got the A6 (new design) when it came out in '05 and loved it. When I saw the A5 and drove it, I had to have it.  Yes, we all have egos. It is OK to acknowledge that. I get more looks and thumbs up in this car than any other I have owned. Great car and beautiful design lines. Only thing I would change is transmission shifting as low acceleration - it can be a bit jerky.  If you haven't driven one - do it!","Front end, lights, and interior - meteor grey with brown ball glove leather - what a combo",None
4.875,Inspiring!,Inspiring! ,08/14/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"This car is incredible. You cannot look at it & not be moved or inspired. Anyone who loves cars immediately gravititate to its inspiring curves and uniqueness, a classic. People are just drawn to its stunning design. ","The sheet metal, interior fit & finish (of course!... it's an Audi), 500 watt sound system, the pride of ownership. This car is simply beautiful!",Full on sun roof?
5,Better than the S4 Cabroilet,peter ,08/12/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I have driven the A5 since turning back my S4 since May.  Wow, what an exciting car this is!  I like it better than the S4 and find the power to be almost the same. This car is so well engineered with the weight distribution that it allows the 6 cylinder engine to put like a kitten. Gas mileage is reasonable, the running lights are amazing, the exterior design is nothing short of superb, and the interior is both roomy and driver friendly. I could not be without the backup camera due to neck surgery that will not allow me to turn my neck. The backup camera and assistance in backing up are a life saver, as well.  I cannot say enough about the A5's drive. I am in love.","Great drive, beautiful headlight system, good gas mileage, beautiful exterior lines, great sound system and the best has to be the navigation system with the backup camera with parking assistance.","A little disappointed when I was told the car came with voice activation only to discover it didn't. Oh well, a minor glitch but still well worth the purchase."
4.875,This car rocks,Kenneth Durocher ,08/06/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,This car is the best handeling car I have ever had the pleasure to drive. I purchased an A5 not the S5 after I had driven both. I could not justify the price difference. I ordered it with the s line package and could not be more pleased. This car is rock solid and handles great. Highly recomend taking a test drive. ,Gadgets galore,Make this car get 50 MPG and it will be perfect
5,First time I've ever loved my car,Huy ,07/23/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I've had my A5 for almost 4 months now, and I still spend a couple moments to admire it before I get in to drive each day. I drove it through the mountains this weekend and had so much fun that I was actually laughing out loud. The handling is great, it's totally comfortable and even has enough room in the back for a child seat. I haven't had a single complaint come up.  And yes, it definitely turns a lot of heads when I'm driving it through town.  It actually took me a while to get used to all the stares - not that I'm complaining.","The exterior design is simply in a class of its own. I can't help but smile every time I'm walking towards my car in the parking lot.  The upgraded B&H sound system is also amazing, and highly recommended.   ",Nothing that I can think of at this time.
4.75,A5-Star Rating!,HermanH ,06/28/2008,,,5,5,5,4,,5,5,4,5,"Having never owned a luxury car, this is my first and it did not disappoint my idea of what Audi luxury (or any other manufacturer for that matter) is all about. It is also my first production coupe ownership as well (if you don't count my replica kit roadster.) The exterior of the car is in a class all it's own. It takes some sports car queues and blends them into the coupe in a way no other manufacturer has done as of late. The main attraction are the LED's. People stare, point, stay glued to their rear-view mirrors. The stance from the rear is elegant yet very strong with the 255 wide tires!  Interior is simply first class for me. My first leather interior. I love this car.","LED DRL's! The whole body shape. Milano leather all electric seats. MMI. Memory Keys/remote. Power delivery above 2,000 RPM. Paddle shifters for the tiptronic. 5 spoke Y wheels. The body shape.",Would have liked ventilated seats as standard.
4.875,People Crash For It,AudiConvert ,06/13/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"I have owned this car for a couple of months now, and all I can say is wow. Though it is down on horsepower compared to the BMW 335, it completely makes up in looks. Two months ago, I was at a stop light on a main road. A man was too busy looking at my A5, he drove into the car in front of him. I love the fact I got parked in front of the restaurant by valet. I love that I cannot go a night without a compliment, I just love the car.","Looks. Color combo (Deep Sea Blue w/ Cinnamon leather), navigation system, quality, fit and finish, the fact it is rare","Make the engine compare more to the BMW 335, rather than the 328. Make it easier To find"
4.875,First month update,Franklin ,06/11/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"After a few weeks of ownership, I have learned that the A5 continues to impress, and truly is the beautiful girl whom you can marry and live with. The most amazing epiphany is remarkable fuel efficiency that exceeds EPA estimates of 18 and 27. I have averaged 26 in city, 34 on highway! My weekly trip to Costco also revealed I could transport abundant cargo; 3 large boxes of diapers and baby wipes, detergent, gallons of juice, and more. ",The iPhone integration is seemless and voice quality is excellent. Fuel efficiency is appreciated with $4 a gallon gas. Rear-view camera quality with parking guide is very helpful and easy to use.,Cruise control is poorly positioned behind steering wheel and is hidden from view.
4.625,My first impressions,Franklin ,05/30/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,4,4,5,"My first week with A5 reveals it's a well-made car. Exterior design appears even much more beautiful in real life than the pictures. Walter de Silva (designer) was right when he says A5 is his best design. Interior design is peerless, controls perfect and intuitive, fit and finish defines fit and finish. Audi design doing in the auto world what Apple computers did in the computer world. Performance of the V-6 is not as robust as the BMW 335i coupe, which was the other car to choose from.  However, A5 is powerful enough for everything besides drag- racing. ","I admire the exterior design, LED lights, advanced key, Bluetooth phone and MMI, quattro stability, beautiful cinnamon brown leather seats matches black exterior.","Not much to improve. Perhaps more horsepower, but this would decrease gas mileage. A5's 265 hp might be the sweet spot between power and fuel efficiency. In summary, A5 beats out BMW 335i and Infiniti G37 from a refinemen and design standpoint."
5,I'm in heaven,Chicago Audi Owner ,05/29/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Drop dead gorgeous. Da Silva is a genius. This is my first Audi (but coincidentally, this is the 6th among my whole family).  Almost bought the 3 series and then saw the A5 was coming out in the states. The outside is absolutely stunning, the inside design is beautiful but ridiculously comfortable. I drive 3 hours a day going to and from work and my commute couldn't be any more fun than it is now. Audi's made me a fan for life.",The entire car design. The engine and handling. The interior. The high gas mileage for the neck snapping performance.  Would love an S5 but not for the commute - couldn't ask for more efficiency with this much power.,"Finding out voice activation wasn't ""activated"" was the only disappointing event after I bought the car. While every other part of the car exceeded its competition, I found the navigation was somewhat inferior to Infiniti's nav system that included traffic..."
4.75,Outstanding,Vinny ,05/20/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,3,5,"All I can say is if you are thinking about buying it and you have the money to do so do it.  it is the nicest car I've owned and I own many cars including BMW's and Mercedes. When you drive down the highway the amount of brakelights you see in the opposite direction as the try to catch a longer glimpse of you is astounding.The car is amazing, I love it!","My hands down favorite features are those sexy daytime running lightsand the lines on the side panels, and of course the way the front mereges cleanily with the roof into the back...from the side it kinda looks like a Porsche the way the roof merges with the trunk.",Really not to many suggested improvements I can think of except the fuel economy. One downside but then again if you buying this car you shouldnt really be worrying about the price of gas.  
5,Best Luxury Coup - Audi A5,Rich ,05/18/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"The A5 is a truly exceptional car. The finish and fit is perfect.  Absolutely no imperfections. The suspension is firm but not harsh with very slight oversteer. It is comfortable, fast, and gets a lot of attention everywhere I go. The fuel economy is better than the ratings indicate. On a recent 1400 mile trip from Ft. Lauderdale to Gainesville GA and back, I averaged 30.85 miles per gallon at 80-85 MPH. ",My favorite feature is the handling. The all wheel drive makes for exceptional cornering. I also love that it gets good gas milage.,"The a/c is good, but could be a little stronger - especially after it's been sitting in the sun on a 90+ degree Florida afternoon."
5,Unreal,New A5 Owner ,05/06/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Forget turning heads, this car snaps necks. I have only had the car 2 weeks, but there is nothing I am not thrilled with.  The value, drive, style and technology are all superior to any other car I considered.  I originally wanted an S5, but just cannot justify the extra ~90HP given the fuel economy difference.   ","This car is amazing, inside and out.  From the LED running lights through the curves and lines of the body, this car has a presence that is unmistakable and magnetic. Make sure you get the S package for the 19"" Y spoke wheels.","If I had to nitpick, I would ask for a TDI to be available and for the tech package to not require the Navi and Premium packages which it currently requires.  But really, this is esentially as perfect as a car gets. "
4.75,Almost perfect,houstontechguy ,05/04/2008,,,5,5,4,5,,5,5,4,5,"I am a huge fan of Audis, and this one takes the cake. It's got a gorgeous body shape (kudos to Walter de'Silva), perfect watchmaker-quality interior, and is oh-so-fun to drive.  It's not a barnburner like the S5, but it's more than adequate for me and will save me a few speeding tickets. I've had so many second glances, head turns, and people stopping me in parking lots and traffic lights to ask about it.  I actually like the fact that they're very rare and will slowly trickle onto the market over the next 1-2 years. For people who like to blend in the crowd and follow the status quo, then go buy a boring BMW (with crap interior and total crap stereo/tech). This A5 is for me!","Amazing B&O stereo, interior appointments and quality, ride quality (except for small road bumps).  Of course, the LED dayrunner lights are way cool!  And, the trunk is massive.","Voice activation (you put the button there, but no cookie!), paint qualilty (orange-peel is very), and a little more seat side bolstering would help too."
4.875,Best I've Ever Owned,CTguy ,04/28/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"This car is truly the first car I've ever been excited to own and to drive. The exterior design is breathtaking, the interior quality is phenomenal. If you're looking to have adults ride in the back seat, this isn't the car for you (especially if you're tall like I am). MMI much easier to use that BMW's iDrive; iPod integration and Sirius satellite makes the 6CD changer almost an afterthought. Cellphone with Bluetooth integrates in seconds. Manual 6 makes the most out of the engine; I recommend it over the 6A (the gimmicky faux manual in it isn't that exciting). Trunk is huge, overly large for its class. ","Exterior styling (headlights are fantastic and beautiful), interior build quality, Bluetooth and iPod integration, navigation, handling and braking.","Activate the voice control for navigation and telephone dialing. A little more room in the backseat would make this car perfect, in my estimation. "
4.5,Wow - What a Surprise!,chi-chi88 ,04/13/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,4,4,4,"I've owned everything from Porsche 911 to the Cayenne Turbo, from Lexus SC430 to BMW 745i and Mercedes CLS. For the money this new AUDI ""Rocks"". Don't sell the 911 but for everyday zips to work this new A5 not only saves a little in gas but offers on nice comfortable ride. If you like all the bells with true performance then this car is for you and if your luck to own, you know what I mean. Thanks Audi!","Off the line acceleration for a six is impressive. Interior and exterior design. My son put it best ""there isn't anything about this car I don't like"". ",Need to offer a front parking system option to match the rear. Air ride feature would be nice. Seat comfort is still not up to others even with the $1000.00 upgrade?
4.75,New A5 Owner,wongo ,03/29/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,4,4,5,"Owning and driving this vehicle is like a breath of fresh air. Despite the fact that it's a lot of fun to drive, the positive attention that is received is unbelievable. I was surprised that certain people had no idea that Audi was launching an A5 model until they saw mine on the road.",The look and styling of the car is immaculate. I cannot keep my eyes off of it. The daytime running LED lights are a huge hit and the S-Line package that is available on the A5 is actually nicer looking than the S5. ,"The panoramic sunroof. The ""tilt up"" is just not enough. My A5 has the button for the ""voice command"" feature. It is even described in the manual, however according to my dealer, they are stating that Audi decided to not put this feature in the car. Only in Europe. Is this true? "
5,"First Audi..great coupe, quality & quick",First Reviewer ,03/23/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"My first Audi and so far is excellent. Loaded A5 (all options except S-line package), ride is fantastic...great in corners, straight, smooth and very quiet on highways. Acceleration is very good and feels quick (better then my '05 Acura TL), especially in sport mode. Audi delivers amazing interiors with high quality. Backseat is okay for small kids, but almost unusable for adults. I'm a tall/big guy who fits very comfortably up front. Technology is great - imports entire Blackberry phone book in one shot with excellent Bluetooth connection.  MMI is not difficult to learn, but can be cumbersome. Voice activation not live on the A5.  Overall, great blend of luxury and sporty ride. ","Quality interior, styling, technology, rise (acceleration and quiet).",Turn on voice activation.
5,It's an amazing ride,Nelson ,03/11/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"With fuel prices the way they are, I just couldn't see living with the low mileage of the 8 cyl, so I opted for the 6 cyl instead.  The dealer had an A5 with an Audi factory installed S5 option (cosmetic kit) so I have S-Line interior trim, upgraded 19"" wheels (that I like better than the ""S"") and claimed mileage up to 32 MPG (we'll see - I do a lot of highway driving).",The AWD is cool in the corners - and the electronics package is complete.,I would have liked an external video input for a video iPod.
5,Audi Gets It Right,LGA5 ,02/26/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I've owned more than 18 cars over the past 23 years (mostly premium imports -- Audi, BMW, MB, Lexus, Acura), and the A5 is one of my favorites.  It's an exceptional combination of style, performance, comfort and build quality.  No car can do everything perfectly, but this one does so many things extremely well.  I might even keep this car longer than a year or two.      ","Styling -- I'm not overly concerned by what others think of my car, but I have gotten a kick out of how many heads this car turns. Build quality -- does anyone do interiors better than Audi?","The back seat is tight for adults.  My kids fit back there, but a few more inches of leg room and another inch of headroom would have made this car just about flawless."
4.875,Super Car for those in the know,Yuriy ,02/14/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,A5 is not for everyone. It's for the experienced drivers to savor all the perks of driving very touchy and agile vehicle. Strong. Solid design in and out.,"Design-wise, I love the daytime running lights made as a stripe of lights underscoring the headlights. Driving is a vacation from work and family, if you know what I mean. This car provides both.","More attention to the soundproofing of the shock absorbers,especially of the rear wheels. I can hear every pot hole as if sitting in an empty can. Other than that, it's perfect."
4.875,One of the first owners of an A5,MS.goddess ,01/06/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Audi is the only car that I would even consider driving through the countryside of England in the winter(!) period, especially with my children in tow. This company is doing everything right and has even surpassed BMW (I still own a Mini) in quality and comfort. Audi has won me over in consistency and an above average desire to please its new customers. These cars contain something the others have lost - character. Audi is the company that got me interested in automobiles which I never thought would happen.",The interior is the most comfortable of any mass produced vehicles in the world period! I have owned everything and even some things in between and Audi is the car of now.,More diesel options and more interior options.
