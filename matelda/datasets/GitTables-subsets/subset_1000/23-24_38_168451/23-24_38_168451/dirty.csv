If you live where there are maybe 20 people per acre and most people are born somewhere different (<i>cough</i> Miami, Atlanta, Phoenix <i>cough</i>) it can be very lonely because there are few institutions that gather people together, and also there are fewer opportunities to bump into your neighbors.<p>In low-density, low-transient places like rural towns the biggest problem isn't loneliness -- it's how to get people out of your hair.<p>If you live where everyone is from everywhere but they are packed so tightly you have to get along, it's much easier to make friends. People also tend to spend more time outside their homes because they are so small.",1228088618

Even for networking purposes, if you were not interested in the topic (or atleast if it was not your highest priority), how would the speaker be of benefit to you?  And wouldnt this imply a fake interest in the topic just to approach the speaker?  And wouldnt this fake interest show sooner than later?",1228088204

I know that in Chicago  the freeways have speed sensors spaced pretty closely together, so it is possible to look at that data and immediately know how long you are going to spend on the freeway.  If you use that data to determine your route, then you should avoid traffic jams.<p>Obviously conditions can change pretty quickly, but most of the time they don't.

It's hard to find a co-lo that doesn't have excessive fees for 'not knowing exactly what you will need for the next two years'  -  I myself have gotten in trouble with bandwidth contracts.<p>My point is just that at $700 for 4 cores/15G, you are better off paying for a server if you need at least two and stay more than two months.  (I pay under $2500 for 8 cores/32G ram)  Even if you buy a dell and have to pay for the more expensive 4GB modules ('cause all the dells I know of only have 8 ram slots) and pay for the 'sales guy tax'  I imagine you aren't more than twice that, unless you get silly on the CPUs, so even then you are talking only 4 months to make your investment back.<p>You do need to be careful about co-lo contracts, though, they are professionals (by which I mean they are really good at screwing you.)  so watch out, and always assume the worst of any document you sign.<p>There are places that let you go month-to-month, especially on the low end.  He.net usually lets you get full racks on a month to month basis, with a reasonable ($500) setup fee... I know lots of smaller providers that give you month-to-month on a per-U basis.  (see rippleweb.net -  I host my backup servers there.  Something like $80 per U/month, but that includes 1TB data transfer, and they let you host one of the aforementioned 8 core monsters without charging extra, and they let you go month to month.)",1228087059
