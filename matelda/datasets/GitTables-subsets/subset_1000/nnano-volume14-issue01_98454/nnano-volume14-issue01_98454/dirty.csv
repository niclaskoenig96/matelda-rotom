review article,Applications of nanolasers,"<p>Nanolasers generate coherent light at the nanoscale. In the past decade, they have attracted intense interest, because they are more compact, faster and more power-efficient than conventional lasers. Thanks to these capabilities, nanolasers are now an emergent tool for a variety of practical applications. In this Review, we explain the intrinsic merits of nanolasers and assess recent progress on their applications, particularly for optical interconnects, near-field spectroscopy and sensing, optical probing for biological systems and far-field beam synthesis through near-field eigenmode engineering. We highlight the scientific and engineering challenges that remain for forging nanolasers into powerful tools for nanoscience and nanotechnology.</p>",[],False,"[""Ren-Min Ma"", ""Rupert F.

letter,Two-photon interference in the telecom C-band after frequency conversion of photons from remote quantum emitters,"<p>Efficient fibre-based long-distance quantum communication via quantum repeaters relies on deterministic single-photon sources at telecom wavelengths, potentially exploiting the existing world-wide infrastructures. For upscaling the experimental complexity in quantum networking, two-photon interference (TPI) of remote non-classical emitters in the low-loss telecom bands is of utmost importance. Several experiments have been conducted regarding TPI of distinct emitters, for example, using trapped atoms, ions, nitrogen vacancy centres, silicon vacancy centres, organic molecules and semiconductor quantum dots. However, the spectral range was far from the highly desirable telecom C-band. Here, we exploit quantum frequency conversion to realize TPI at 1,550&#8201;nm with single photons stemming from two remote quantum dots. We thereby prove quantum frequency conversion as a bridging technology and a precise and stable mechanism to erase the frequency difference between independent emitters. On resonance, a TPI visibility of 29&#8201;&#8201;&#177; 3% has been observed, limited only by the spectral diffusion processes of the individual quantum dots. The local fibre network used covers several rooms between two floors of the building. Even the addition of up to 2&#8201;km of fibre channel shows no influence on the TPI visibility, proving the photon wavepacket distortion to be negligible. Our studies pave the way to establish long-distance entanglement distribution between remote solid-state emitters including interfaces with various quantum hybrid systems.</p>",[],False,"[""Jonas H.

letter,Spin–orbit torque driven by a planar Hall current,"<p>Spin&#8211;orbit torques (SOTs) in multilayers of ferromagnetic (FM) and non-magnetic (NM) metals can manipulate the magnetization of the FM layer efficiently. This is employed, for example, in non-volatile magnetic memories for energy-efficient mobile electronics and spin torque nano-oscillators for neuromorphic computing. Recently, spin torque nano-oscillators also found use in microwave-assisted magnetic recording, which enables ultrahigh-capacity hard disk drives. Most SOT devices employ spin Hall and Rashba effects, which originate from spin&#8211;orbit coupling within the NM layer and at the FM/NM interfaces, respectively. Recently, SOTs generated by the anomalous Hall effect in FM/NM/FM multilayers were predicted and experimentally realized. The control of SOTs through crystal symmetry was demonstrated as well. Understanding all the types of SOTs that can arise in magnetic multilayers is needed for a formulation of a comprehensive SOT theory and for engineering practical SOT devices. Here we show that a spin-polarized electric current known to give rise to anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) and the planar Hall effect (PHE) in a FM can additionally generate large antidamping SOTs with an unusual angular symmetry in NM<sub>1</sub>/FM/NM<sub>2</sub> multilayers. This effect can be described by a recently proposed magnonic mechanism. Our measurements reveal that this torque can be large in multilayers in which both spin Hall and Rashba torques are negligible. Furthermore, we demonstrate the operation of a spin torque nano-oscillator driven by this SOT. These findings significantly expand the class of materials that exhibit giant SOTs.</p>",[],False,"[""Christopher Safranski"", ""Eric A. Montoya"", ""Ilya N.

letter,Robust topologically protected transport in photonic crystals at telecommunication wavelengths,"<p>Photonic topological insulators offer the possibility to eliminate backscattering losses and improve the efficiency of optical communication systems. Despite considerable efforts, a direct experimental demonstration of theoretically predicted robust, lossless energy transport in topological insulators operating at near-infrared frequencies is still missing. Here, we combine the properties of a planar silicon photonic crystal and the concept of topological protection to design, fabricate and characterize an optical topological insulator that exhibits the valley Hall effect. We show that the transmittances are the same for light propagation along a straight topological interface and one with four sharp turns. This result quantitatively demonstrates the suppression of backscattering due to the non-trivial topology of the structure. The photonic-crystal-based approach offers significant advantages compared with other realizations of photonic topological insulators, such as lower propagation losses, the presence of a band gap for light propagating in the crystal-slab plane, a larger operating bandwidth, a much smaller footprint, compatibility with complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor fabrication technology, and the fact that it allows for operation at telecommunications wavelengths.</p>",[],False,"[""Mikhail I.

letter,Memristor crossbar arrays with 6-nm half-pitch and 2-nm critical dimension,"<p>The memristor is a promising building block for next-generation non-volatile memory, artificial neural networks and bio-inspired computing systems. Organizing small memristors into high-density crossbar arrays is critical to meet the ever-growing demands in high-capacity and low-energy consumption, but this is challenging because of difficulties in making highly ordered conductive nanoelectrodes. Carbon nanotubes, graphene nanoribbons and dopant nanowires have potential as electrodes for discrete nanodevices, but unfortunately these are difficult to pack into ordered arrays. Transfer printing, on the other hand, is effective in generating dense electrode arrays but has yet to prove suitable for making fully random accessible crossbars. All the aforementioned electrodes have dramatically increased resistance at the nanoscale, imposing a significant barrier to their adoption in operational circuits. Here we demonstrate memristor crossbar arrays with a 2-nm feature size and a single-layer density up to 4.5 terabits per square inch, comparable to the information density achieved using three-dimensional stacking in state-of-the-art 64-layer and multilevel 3D-NAND flash memory.

letter,Microwave amplification in a magnetic tunnel junction induced by heat-to-spin conversion at the nanoscale,"<p>Heat-driven engines are hard to realize in nanoscale machines because of efficient heat dissipation. However, in the realm of spintronics, heat has been employed successfully&#8212;for example, heat current has been converted into a spin current in a NiFe|Pt bilayer system, and Joule heating has enabled selective writing in magnetic memory arrays. Here, we use Joule heating in nanoscale magnetic tunnel junctions to create a giant spin torque due to a magnetic anisotropy change. Efficient conversion from heat dynamics to spin dynamics is obtained because of a large interfacial thermal resistance at an FeB|MgO interface. The heat-driven spin torque is equivalent to a voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy of approximately 300&#8201;fJ&#8201;V<sup>&#8722;1</sup>&#8201;m<sup>&#8722;1</sup>, which is more than twice the value reported in a (Co)FeB|MgO system. We demonstrate an electric microwave amplification gain of 20% in a d.c. biased magnetic tunnel junction as a result of this spin torque. While electric d.c. power amplification in spintronic devices has been realized previously, the microwave amplification was limited to relatively small amplification gains (G&#8201;=&#8201;radiofrequency output voltage/radiofrequency input voltage) and has never exceeded 1 (refs ). A magnetic tunnel junction driven by radiofrequency spin transfer torque using ferromagnetic resonance enabled a relatively large gain of G&#8201;&#8776;&#8201;0.55 (ref. ). Furthermore, radiofrequency spin waves were tuned by the spin transfer effect. The heat-driven giant spin torque in the FeB|MgO magnetic tunnel junction, which shows a large magnetization precession and resistance oscillation under a d.c. bias, overcomes the above limitations and provides a gain larger than 1.</p>",[],False,"[""Minori Goto"", ""Yosuke Wakatake"", ""Ugwumsinachi Kalu Oji"", ""Shinji Miwa"", ""Nikita Strelkov"", ""Bernard Dieny"", ""Hitoshi Kubota"", ""Kay Yakushiji"", ""Akio Fukushima"", ""Shinji Yuasa"", ""Yoshishige Suzuki""]","Goto, M., Wakatake, Y., Oji, U.K. et al.

letter,Large-area single-crystal sheets of borophene on Cu(111) surfaces,"<p>Borophene, a theoretically proposed two-dimensional (2D) boron allotrope, has attracted much attention as a candidate material platform for high-speed, transparent and flexible electronics. It was recently synthesized, on Ag(111) substrates, and studied by tunnelling and electron spectroscopy. However, the exact crystal structure is still controversial, the nanometre-size single-crystal domains produced so far are too small for device fabrication and the structural tunability via substrate-dependent epitaxy is yet to be proven. We report on the synthesis of borophene monitored in situ by low-energy electron microscopy, diffraction and scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) and modelled by ab initio theory. We resolved the crystal structure and phase diagram of borophene on Ag(111), but found that the domains remain nanoscale for all growth conditions. However, by growing borophene on Cu(111) surfaces, we obtained large single-crystal domains, up to 100&#8201;&#956;m<sup>2</sup> in size. The crystal structure is a novel triangular network with a concentration of hexagonal vacancies of &#951;&#8201;=&#8201;1/5. Our experimental data, together with first principles calculations, indicate charge-transfer coupling to the substrate without significant covalent bonding.

article,In situ quantification of interphasial chemistry in Li-ion battery,"<p>The solid&#8211;electrolyte interphase (SEI) is probably the least understood component in Li-ion batteries. Considerable effort has been put into understanding its formation and electrochemistry under realistic battery conditions, but mechanistic insights have mostly been inferred indirectly. Here we show the formation of the SEI between a graphite anode and a carbonate electrolyte through combined atomic-scale microscopy and in situ and operando techniques. In particular, we weigh the graphitic anode during its initial lithiation process with an electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance, which unequivocally identifies lithium fluoride and lithium alkylcarbonates as the main chemical components at different potentials. In situ gas analysis confirms the preferential reduction of cyclic over acyclic carbonate molecules, making its reduction product the major component in the SEI. We find that SEI formation starts at graphite edge sites with dimerization of solvated Li<sup>+</sup> intercalation between graphite layers. We also show that this lithium salt, at least in its nascent form, can be re-oxidized, despite the general belief that an SEI is electrochemically inert and its formation irreversible.</p>",[],False,"[""Tongchao Liu"", ""Lingpiao Lin"", ""Xuanxuan Bi"", ""Leilei Tian"", ""Kai Yang"", ""Jiajie Liu"", ""Maofan Li"", ""Zonghai Chen"", ""Jun Lu"", ""Khalil Amine"", ""Kang Xu"", ""Feng Pan""]","Liu, T., Lin, L., Bi, X. et al.

When these blend devices operate as solar cells they deliver an open circuit voltage that approaches their radiative limit thanks to the synergistic effect of the reduced trap-state density and the density of state modification in the nanocomposite.</p>",[],False,"[""Santanu Pradhan"", ""Francesco Di Stasio"", ""Yu Bi"", ""Shuchi Gupta"", ""Sotirios Christodoulou"", ""Alexandros Stavrinadis"", ""Gerasimos Konstantatos""]","Pradhan, S., Di Stasio, F., Bi, Y. et al.

article,Nanoscale tweezers for single-cell biopsies,"<p>Much of the functionality of multicellular systems arises from the spatial organization and dynamic behaviours within and between cells. Current single-cell genomic methods only provide a transcriptional &#8216;snapshot&#8217; of individual cells. The real-time analysis and perturbation of living cells would generate a step change in single-cell analysis. Here we describe minimally invasive nanotweezers that can be spatially controlled to extract samples from living cells with single-molecule precision. They consist of two closely spaced electrodes with gaps as small as 10&#8211;20&#8201;nm, which can be used for the dielectrophoretic trapping of DNA and proteins. Aside from trapping single molecules, we also extract nucleic acids for gene expression analysis from living cells without affecting their viability. Finally, we report on the trapping and extraction of a single mitochondrion. This work bridges the gap between single-molecule/organelle manipulation and cell biology and can ultimately enable a better understanding of living cells.</p>",[],False,"[""Binoy Paulose Nadappuram"", ""Paolo Cadinu"", ""Avijit Barik"", ""Alexander J.

article,In situ sprayed bioresponsive immunotherapeutic gel for post-surgical cancer treatment,"<p>Cancer recurrence after surgical resection remains a significant cause of treatment failure. Here, we have developed an in situ formed immunotherapeutic bioresponsive gel that controls both local tumour recurrence after surgery and development of distant tumours. Briefly, calcium carbonate nanoparticles pre-loaded with the anti-CD47 antibody are encapsulated in the fibrin gel and scavenge H<sup>+</sup> in the surgical wound, allowing polarization of tumour-associated macrophages to the M1-like phenotype. The released anti-CD47 antibody blocks the &#8216;don&#8217;t eat me&#8217; signal in cancer cells, thereby increasing phagocytosis of cancer cells by macrophages. Macrophages can promote effective antigen presentation and initiate T cell mediated immune responses that control tumour growth. Our findings indicate that the immunotherapeutic fibrin gel &#8216;awakens&#8217; the host innate and adaptive immune systems to inhibit both local tumour recurrence post surgery and potential metastatic spread.</p>",[],False,"[""Qian Chen"", ""Chao Wang"", ""Xudong Zhang"", ""Guojun Chen"", ""Quanyin Hu"", ""Hongjun Li"", ""Jinqiang Wang"", ""Di Wen"", ""Yuqi Zhang"", ""Yifei Lu"", ""Guang Yang"", ""Chen Jiang"", ""Jun Wang"", ""Gianpietro Dotti"", ""Zhen Gu""]","Chen, Q., Wang, C., Zhang, X. et al.
