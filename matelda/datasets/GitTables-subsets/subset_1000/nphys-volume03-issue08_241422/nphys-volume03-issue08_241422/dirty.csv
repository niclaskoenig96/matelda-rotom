letter,What happened before the Big Bang?,"<p>Was the Universe before the Big Bang of classical nature, described well by a smooth space&#8211;time? Or was it in a highly fluctuating quantum state? This is one of the most basic questions that we may ask once it is accepted that there was something before the Big Bang. Loop quantum gravity applied to isotropic models has shown that the quantum evolution of a wavefunction extends through the Big Bang. Although a general demonstration is still lacking, this may suggest that calculations, and possibly future indirect observations, may allow us to see the Universe as it was before the Big Bang. Here, we analyse an explicit model with a pre-Big Bang era, indicating limitations that would imply that it is practically impossible to answer some of our questions. Assumptions (or prejudice) will remain necessary for knowing the precise state of the Universe, which cannot be fully justified within science itself.</p>",[],True,"[""Martin Bojowald""]","Bojowald, M.

letter,Weather in stellar atmosphere revealed by the dynamics of mercury clouds in α Andromedae,"<p>The formation of long-lasting structures at the surfaces of stars is commonly ascribed to the action of strong magnetic fields. This paradigm is supported by observations of evolving cool spots in the Sun and active late-type stars, and stationary chemical spots in the early-type magnetic stars. However, results of our seven-year monitoring of mercury spots in non-magnetic early-type star &#945;&#160;Andromedae show that the picture of magnetically driven structure formation is fundamentally incomplete. Using an indirect stellar-surface mapping technique, we construct a series of two-dimensional images of starspots and discover a secular evolution of the mercury cloud cover in this star. This remarkable structure-formation process, observed for the first time in any star, is plausibly attributed to a non-equilibrium, dynamical evolution of the heavy-element clouds created by atomic diffusion, and may have the same underlying physics as the weather patterns on terrestrial and giant planets.</p>",[],True,"[""Oleg Kochukhov"", ""Saul J.

letter,Violation of the London law and Onsager–Feynman quantization in multicomponent superconductors,"<p>Non-classical response to rotation is a hallmark of quantum ordered states such as superconductors and superfluids. The rotational responses of all currently known single-component &#8216;super&#8217; states of matter (superconductors, superfluids and supersolids) are largely described by two fundamental principles and fall into two categories according to whether the systems are composed of charged or neutral particles: the London law relating the angular velocity to a subsequently established magnetic field and the Onsager&#8211;Feynman quantization of superfluid velocity. These laws are theoretically shown to be violated in a two-component superconductor such as the projected liquid metallic states of hydrogen and deuterium at high pressures. The rotational responses of liquid metallic hydrogen or deuterium identify them as a new class of dissipationless states; they also directly point to a particular experimental route for verification of their existence.</p>",[],True,"[""Egor Babaev"", ""N.

letter,Controlled dephasing of electrons by non-gaussian shot noise,"<p>In a &#8216;controlled dephasing&#8217; experiment, an interferometer loses its coherence owing to entanglement of the interfering electron with a controlled quantum system, which effectively is equivalent to path detection. In previous experiments, only partial dephasing was achieved owing to weak interactions between many detector electrons and the interfering electron, leading to a gaussian-phase randomizing process. Here, we report the opposite extreme, where interference is completely destroyed by a few (that is, one to three) detector electrons, each of which has a strong randomizing effect on the phase. We observe quenching of the interference pattern in a periodic, lobe-type fashion as the detector current is varied, and with a peculiar V-shaped dependence on the detector&#8217;s partitioning. We ascribe these features to the non-gaussian nature of the noise, which is also important for qubit decoherence. In other words, the interference seems to be highly sensitive to the full counting statistics of the detector&#8217;s shot noise.</p>",[],True,"[""Izhar Neder"", ""Florian Marquardt"", ""Moty Heiblum"", ""Diana Mahalu"", ""Vladimir Umansky""]","Neder, I., Marquardt, F., Heiblum, M. et al.

letter,Quantum interference of photon pairs from two remote trapped atomic ions,"<p>Trapped atomic ions are among the most attractive implementations of quantum bits for applications in quantum-information processing, owing to their long trapping lifetimes and long coherence times. Although nearby trapped ions can be entangled through their Coulomb-coupled motion, it seems more natural to entangle remotely located ions through a coupling mediated by photons, eliminating the need to control the ion motion. A promising way to entangle ions via a photonic channel is to interfere two photons emitted from the ions and then detect appropriate photon coincidence events.

letter,Electrical spin-injection into silicon from a ferromagnetic metal/tunnel barrier contact,"<p>The electron&#8217;s spin angular momentum is one of several alternative state variables under consideration on the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) for processing information in the fundamentally new ways that will be required beyond the ultimate scaling limits of silicon-based complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor technology. Electrical injection/transport of spin-polarized carriers is prerequisite for developing such an approach. Although significant progress has been realized in GaAs (ref.&#160;), little progress has been made in Si, despite its overwhelming dominance of the semiconductor industry. Here, we report successful injection of spin-polarized electrons from an iron film through an Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> tunnel barrier into Si(001). The circular polarization of the electroluminescence resulting from radiative recombination in Si and in GaAs (in Si/AlGaAs/GaAs structures) tracks the Fe magnetization, confirming that these spin-polarized electrons originate from the Fe contact. The polarization reflects Fe majority spin. We determine a lower bound for the Si electron spin polarization of 10%, and obtain an estimate of &#8764;30% at 5&#8201;K, with significant polarization extending to at least 125&#8201;K.

letter,Tunable scaling behaviour observed in Barkhausen criticality of a ferromagnetic film,"<p>A ferromagnetic material shows a sequence of discrete and jerky domain jumps, known as the Barkhausen avalanche, in the presence of an external magnetic field. Studies of Barkhausen avalanches reveal power-law scaling behaviour that suggests an underlying criticality, as observed in a wide variety of systems such as superconductor vortices, microfractures, earthquakes, lung inflations, mass extinctions, financial markets and charge-density waves. The most interesting unsolved fundamental question is whether the universality in the scaling exponent holds regardless of the material and its detailed microstructure. Here we show that the scaling behaviour of Barkhausen criticality in a given ferromagnetic film is experimentally tunable by varying the temperature (not dimensionality). We observe for the first time that the scaling behaviour in the Barkhausen criticality of a given system crosses over between two universality classes when the relative contributions from the dipolar interaction and domain-wall energies are altered by an experimental parameter.</p>",[],True,"[""Kwang-Su Ryu"", ""Hiro Akinaga"", ""Sung-Chul Shin""]","Ryu, KS., Akinaga, H. & Shin, SC.

letter,Colossal magnetocapacitance and scale-invariant dielectric response in phase-separated manganites,"<p>Afull characterization of phase separation and the competition between phases is necessary for a comprehensive understanding of strongly correlated electron materials, such as under-doped high-temperature superconductors, complex oxide heterojunctions, spinels, multiferroics, rare-earth ferroelectric manganites and mixed-valence manganites in which phase competition is the dominant mechanism governing the insulator&#8211;metal (IM) transition and the associated colossal magnetoresistance effect. Thin films of strongly correlated electron materials are often grown epitaxially on planar substrates and typically have anisotropic properties that are usually not captured by edge-mounted four-terminal electrical measurements, which are primarily sensitive to in-plane conduction paths. We present an experimental study of anisotropic transport in phase-separated manganite thin films by using an unconventional arrangement of contact electrodes that enables the simultaneous determination of colossal magnetoresistance associated with d.c. transport parallel to the film substrate and colossal magnetocapacitance associated with a.c. transport in the perpendicular direction.

letter,Imaging single atoms in a three-dimensional array,"<p>Asingle neutral atom trapped by light is a promising qubit. It has weak, well-understood interactions with the environment, its internal state can be precisely manipulated, interactions that entangle atoms can be varied from negligible to strong and many single atoms can be trapped near each other in an optical lattice. This collection of features would allow for a relatively large quantum computer if each neutral atom qubit could be independently detected and addressed. A quantum computer with even 50 qubits would allow quantum simulations that are out of the reach of classical computers. So far, fewer than ten single atoms have been simultaneously imaged. Here we demonstrate trapping and imaging of 250 single atoms in a three-dimensional optical lattice and show that imaging is highly unlikely to change the pattern of site occupancy. Our lattice spacing is large enough that, in principle, individual atoms can be addressed, which in combination with reproducible imaging should allow for verifiable filling of vacancies, execution of site-specific quantum gates and measurement of each atom&#8217;s final quantum state.

In spin ice, spin correlations are determined by the &#8216;ice rules&#8217; organizing principle that stabilizes a magnetic state with the same zero-point entropy as water ice.

Such behaviour promises to enable devices whose ability to manipulate information in the form of electronic spin goes well beyond the now ubiquitous spin-valve read heads of magnetoelectronics, and on a platform that is compatible with conventional complementary metal oxide semiconductor technology. Most ferromagnetic semiconductor devices so far have relied on the bulk anisotropic behaviour of their constituent layers. Recent improvements in lithographic patterning enable the fabrication of a novel class of devices in which the anisotropy of many individual elements can be independently engineered.
