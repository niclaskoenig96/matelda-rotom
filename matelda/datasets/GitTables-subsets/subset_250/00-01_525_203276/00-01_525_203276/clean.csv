2501998,comment,2501022,2501633,1,0,tolmasky,,,"The iChat situation is actually more curious. It differs from everything else in a few regards:<p>1. Adium was an open source project that had barely started when iChat came out. The ""true"" competitor in this case was the official AIM client which I'm pretty sure Apple made a deal with AOL. -- This alone should disqualify it from any further discussion.<p>2. AIM is not the dominant network in most other countries (making iChat useless in those cases)<p>3. AOL owns the network and thus its pretty hard for Apple to outright ""kill"" other chat apps.<p>--<p><pre><code>  Why is the concept of a bookmark that can tell you when it has updates a nerd feature?</code></pre>\nI don't know, but it is. I can guarantee you my parents don't know what RSS is. I think the story of RSS is probably pretty interesting, it may be the case that as social started providing better links than one-team blog sites, its use went down, but this is purely speculation on my part.<p>--<p>Spotlight issues are not anecdotal, they were widely reported. Remember that this feature is now 6 years old, but just search on the internet and you will see that Apple's support forums and articles in Apple sites are full of stuff like this:<p><a href=""http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20090422063557423"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=2009042206355742...</a><p><a href=""https://discussions.apple.com/thread/507442?threadID=507442"" rel=""nofollow"">https://discussions.apple.com/thread/507442?threadID=507442</a><p><a href=""https://discussions.apple.com/thread/467039?threadID=467039"" rel=""nofollow"">https://discussions.apple.com/thread/467039?threadID=467039</a><p>(just a few, the more curious can track it more thoroughly)<p>It was so bad for some people that a ""spotless"" application was created to remove it from particularly pesky computers (no zealots ever felt the need to remove expose). It received 4 mice from MacWorld -- <a href=""http://www.fixamacsoftware.com/software/spot/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fixamacsoftware.com/software/spot/</a>!

I will completely concede that these problems have for the most part gone away -- but again, its been 6 years. I'd hate it if this kills Instapaper and it takes a similarly long time to get parity.<p>--<p>I mentioned iTunes in my original post as something that was successful, and my analysis was that it was because it was a ""real"" app: in other words, something Apple cared about and created a team around. I don't think Apple cares that much about Dashboard or Safari RSS.<p>And yes I completely forgot about Sherlock: it does fit the bill really well.

If you believe me then great, but if not, whatever.<p>The pressure aspect is very interesting. As far as I remember, I've always had it, but it varied each time. I've never experienced the splitting in two; that would certainly be strange. I remember one trip where it felt like I was slowly rotating, so that roughly 50% through the trip I was upsidedown. When I rotated the full way and was upright again, I instantly snapped out of it. I often had those kind of ""when X happened, I instantly snapped out"" experiences actually (another time I was walking around and it felt like I was falling (the pressure) away from where I took salvia (in a car), bouncing off people to get back ""up"" to where I was and when I got back, I sat into the car and the door shut, I snapped out of the trip).<p>Hmm, good point. Honestly, it was too long ago and I don't remember. I do remember that after a little while I gave up and dropped the pen. As for knowing if there are people or not, I've had different experiences each time - sometimes I forgot about people completely and was lost in my own world, other times the people were there with me (eg, the car trip I mentioned above, I was interacting with people and it felt like I was bouncing off them to get back to the car, kind of like being the ball in a pinball machine).<p>I've only ever smoked extract, usually in a pipe (the other times in a bong). I have smoked different strength extracts, the weakest being either 5 or 10x, the strongest being perhaps 50x and most often 30 or 35x. I have never tried it any other way (due to availability). I don't remember what strength it was that night or if we used a pipe or bong.<p>I didn't try it again. Thinking about it now, I really don't know why, it seems obvious that I should have, yet somehow it never ocurred to me to do it again. We thought it was a bit of a laugh really, which is probably why we didn't put any effort in recording the solution. Kicking myself now, of course. I remember that day we were doing projects for class or soemthing, so perhaps thats why we decided to program on it, while other days we wouldn't have been, but we did a lot of random programming, so I don't think thats why. I don't have a good answer for it really. Then over time I ended up taking salvia less and less until I stopped altogether, for no other reason than that I just didn't feel like it. Then they banned most formerly-legal drugs here, so now I don't think I can even get any anymore (afaik anyway, I never actually checked after most headshops were closed down here).

I work in the performance and scale group, and I've been experimenting with the speed of these things lately.<p>As an experiment, I wrote a simple, stand alone program that takes a compressed database column and a list of which rows you care about, and does a group by with count.  (We're a column store, so every column is stored separately.)  For 1 billion records, it took about 250 ms.<p>This is on a 4-socket Nehalem, so I had 32 cores and used 32 threads.  If they're using Nehalems as well, and have 1 socket per box, they're using 320 cores.  So they're about a factor of 40 slower than my simple experiment.<p>To be sure, theirs was a general system that presumably runs on their actual data, whereas mine was just an experiment.  Still, it seems quite possible to get the same result with significantly less hardware.",1304208856

It waits until someone else advertises that they have solved the block and then releases their own and rolls back the other person's.<p>There are many optimizations that can be made to improve this exploit. The exploit completely ruins any hope for bitcoins being an unmanipulated currency.<p>Even in the base case scenario where multiple cartels compete to dominate the bitcoins, the average person will be squeezed out and all the advantage will go to the cartels. It will end up WORSE than other currencies based on the credibility of the various governments.<p>The bitcoin concept is inherently flawed because cpu power is not democratic. Especially when it comes to the implementation details of bitcoins, which are actually very inefficiently computed on a regular person's computer. Purpose-built bitcoin computers are orders of magnitude more effective than normal computers, compounding the other issues with bitcoins.<p>The fact that most people's CPU cycles are migrating toward mobile battery powered devices does not help either. How many people do you know who still have bulky desktop computers plugged into the network 24/7 rather than mobile battery powered devices that spend more time offline than online?",1304208794

That said, I don't know of a law that says you can't also use an alternative currency.

There are literally a billion possible factors that could be responsible besides a direct relationship.  Of course, the same applies to any research demonstrating the efficacy of Omega-3s, too.<p>This is the problem with a lot of nutrition studies: a huge number of completely false associations were and still are being invented because of an inability to control for important factors.  For example, the ""fiber theory"" of health has turned out to be almost completely false: it appeared to be ""healthy"" because eating fiber meant eating fewer (digested) carbohydrates.  The fiber itself did almost nothing for health.<p>It gets worse when massive chains of correlations are assumed to be causes.

If patent law is proven to not cover the innovations that the lawmakers intend it too then that doesn't mean that those innovations will no longer be protected it means that there has been a drafting error.
