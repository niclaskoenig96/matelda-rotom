606325,comment,605525,606278,0,0,wheels,,,"I think this resonates with some because the line is unclear.  I've had boobs show up on my work machine before when I followed innocent seeming links.  Heck, last week one of my new twitter followers was porn spam that had a full frontal nude as a profile pic.<p>Where I live prostitution is legal (though I personally find it rather icky).  I don't know what my response would be to co-workers looking up info on a brothel at work, but it wouldn't be to call the police.<p>When I worked at SAP of all places, on their list of entertainment venues in the area of the headquarters, one of the links on the intranet wiki was to a gay club that has dark rooms.  If an SAP employee in the contested jurisdiction clicked on that link, would they be a felon?<p>This guy was clearly over the line, but I'd find it hard to say exactly where it is.  If what he did made him a felon, I'd be hard pressed to say where the line is between him and the cases above.  Since only one of the ""nasty"" activities that he committed was illegal (and that not even universally in the US) it is chilling that the legal system was rigged to find a way to convict him on a  serious count that was put in place for entirely different reasons.",1242175406

606320,comment,606180,606254,0,0,awt,,,"I would disagree with the argument that there are lower bounds.  That precludes the possibility that there are more efficient ways to solve the problems addressed by say, the fire dept. or the police dept.  For example, let's say marijuana were legalized and officers no longer needed to enforce drug laws related to marijuana.  This could reduce the required outlay to the police department and judicial system.  I'm certain that all sorts of systemic changes are possible that would make the system more efficient, but without downward pressure on tax rates, they will never be implemented.",1242174760

606311,comment,606203,606203,0,0,Batsu,,,"I've often wondered this myself, seeing as though when I was somewhat in the pirating scene the only game that ever even remotely resisted it was XIII (in hilarious ways, might I add). It always seemed like a waste of time and money that they would bother attempting to prevent it, as well as developing the protection itself. Also, the author of the article brings about a good point regarding the horrible DRM that Spore contained (limited number of installs):<p><i>""Publishers aren't stupid. They know that DRM doesn't work against piracy,"" he explains. ""What they're trying to do is stop people from going to GameStop to buy $50 games for $35, none of which goes into the publishers' pockets. If DRM permits only a few installs, that minimizes the number of times a game can be resold.""</i><p>In the end, the DRM is still about the money - or more specifically, who sees the money.",1242174234

In general, I think people can react to having overcome adversity extremely differently. From the kind of identity & pride you mention (the falsifiers feeling) to extreme shame. My instinct is that the relatively harder cases tend towards the shame.<p>*BTW, Well said.",1242174128

606298,comment,606201,606201,0,0,krschultz,,,"""21. Toilet Paper, and All That Goes With It\nWhen there’s a rainstorm, far more water goes into our drainage system than sewage-treatment plants can handle. So the overflow pipes open wide, and all our wastewater—including the untreated effluvia of 8 million people—goes straight into the ocean. The day after a storm, the harbor is brown and thick with stirred-up silt that is shot through with human waste. Sometimes you can see shreds of toilet paper. When divers emerge from the harbor on those days, their suits have to be scrubbed down with bleach or kerosene before the men can strip them off.""<p>This happens along the coastline around America quietly many times a year. Generally the outflow pipes are 1-2 miles offshore so if you aren't in a boat you don't see it, but as a sailor I see it two or three times a year in my home waters. This is why I always scoff at people who talk about MPG or global warming or anything else - we don't even separate storm run off from sewage in this country because a lot of towns saved some money by running one set of pipes - why are you worrying about possible effects of CO2 when there are massive effects happening from something we have the technology to solve today.",1242173390
