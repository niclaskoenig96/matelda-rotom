3812872,comment,3812588,3812848,4,0,NyxWulf,,,"I'll play.  I worked at a financial institution for several years.  On the one hand you'd think we were secure because we used a relational database, but we also had a heavily segmented network with all of the databases in their own VLAN's with highly restrictive permissions.  On top of that each application was locked down to exactly which data it could use and what could be done with that data.<p>So if you buy the premise of the article, it wasn't NoSQL, so it must have been secure.  In reality we were very secure from external breaches, at least as secure as you can reasonably be.<p>Personal information was secured to the maximum extent possible.  Encrypted, backed up to multiple independent tapes stored in separate locations etc.  On the other hand, the overall complexity of the system was very high and if someone breached our network there would have been a very large surface area to attack.  I didn't feel like the article addressed this aspect of security in the least.  Security just isn't one of those things that are easy or are ever done.  It takes constant vigilance and continuous adjustment and improvement.",1333853741
3812871,comment,3811319,3812594,1,0,jarrett,,,"This is not legal advice. Please don't try to build one of these devices. I haven't researched this answer. But off the top of my head:<p>My guess is it's legal to have a phone that can be programmed to perform activities at specified times. You'd essentially just be making robo-calls/robo-texts, which lots of people do. For example, I get a lot of texts from political campaigns, and I wouldn't be surprised if these were written then scheduled to automatically go out at a certain time.<p>That being said, fabricating evidence is clearly a crime. So, I suspect that you could legally build and possess such a device, but could be guilty of a crime depending on how you use it. The same could be said of probably any non-contraband object.<p>Again, don't build one of these on my say-so. I'm just speculating.<p>As to the second part of your question--how the law would look at this kind of evidence in light of the possibility of fabricating it--that really depends on the jury. As it would play out in court, the party presenting the phone evidence would try to convince the jury that it's authentic, e.g. with expert testimony. Likewise, the other party could try to raise doubts as to its authenticity, perhaps by bringing expert witnesses of their own, who would testify about how easy it is to fake and such. And then it would be the jury's decision to give the evidence as much or as little weight as they see fit. So, there's no one-size-fits-all answer. It would depend entirely on the case each side makes and the whims of the jury.",1333853719

I'm also a vulnerability researcher who makes his way in the world finding and dissecting security bugs and holes in network infrastructure.<p>I feel this article misrepresents a lot of facts about security in the same way that articles discussing the relative security of passwords misrepresent security.<p>Here's what I mean<p>Question: Whats the most obvious way to attack a system? Answer: Guess Passwords.<p>Because this is the most obvious way to attack computer systems, an undue amount of attention is paid to the topic because it's the only way we're aware of. In reality the vast majority of systems compromised happen because of memory corruption vulnerabilities, or in recent years, (predominantly) web bugs like SQLi and LFI. Explaining the dynamics of taking control of a program through smashing the stack and getting EIP is tough, at least in contrast to explaining how guessing passwords works. So people worry that ""their passwords aren't secure"" despite that any real black hat deleted D8.dic off their harddrive years ago. Thus, theres a million articles and sites on how secure your password is, but not that many to check if you've got address randomization enabled.<p>Are Blackhats trying to read your NoSQL stores after staging an internal attack? Possibly, but not nearly as likely as the fact that you've got xp_cmdshell enabled. Attacking MongoDB is tractable, and provides numerous opportunities for a wide nop sled w/ memory mapped files and more than enough opportunity for use-after-free attacks in objects, but the same (and then some!) can be said of any modern SQL database.<p>The fact that query strings are safe in every major NoSQL datastore is such a massive advantage over SQL DBs that, even if you're using prepared statements, NoSQL is almost assuredly more secure in a day to day context, except against zero-days (Which we can reasonably say are less frequent in established datastores, irrespective of their design decisions).<p>The fact that he quasi-attacks stateful firewall security in the article is pretty much baseless, clever TCP bugs are long since worn out, and all the things that mainstream developers have thought is clever like firewalk(8) haven't been effective since I was 11. It's not unreasonable to trust major commercial firewalls for anything you'd trust SSH for. It's not reasonable to trust C/C++ applications in general, as even the most valorous efforts at secure software have turned up short (The beautiful irony here may be that SSH, as trusted as it is, has had numerous pre-auth exploits in it, as it is written in C++)<p>Finally, let's be real, as an article aside -- SSL does absolutely nothing. Every single year there are multiple complete breaks in what SSL is supposed to do, both practical and theoretical. These complete breaks are regularly released with executables, so don't give me that ""We're only raising the ba-"" Nope, ASLR and W^X raise the bar, you could argue SSL widens your attack surface on anything but HTTP transactions. Furthermore, if MITM is the biggest thing you're worried about then I'd encourage you to download any of the latest XML parsing libraries or PDF readers to rectify that -- it's tragically only minor exaggeration to say attacking these complex, loosely interacting components such as parsers to stage a more complex internal attack <i>is</i> organizational computer hacking in 2012.",1333852516

However, if they are doing implants the only way to do it in a timely basis is immediate placement (stick the implant in the bone and put a crown on) instead of installing the implant and waiting for the bone to heal.  Additionally, good luck in getting a stateside dentist to support foreign dental work.  The statement that dentistry has been around since Roman times is laughable; certainly not modern dentistry and definitely not implant dentistry.<p>Here's a brief overview of the economics:<p>230K student loans, 6K / month business loan for office, 2K / month rent (fairly cheap IMO), salaries for staff, malpractice, lab fees, etc.  So there is clearly a lot of shit to pay for.
