Loved it.<p>I feel like this is part of a larger bias among scientists to view the history of science as a clear progression from worse methods of explanation to better. This pernicious misreading of history seems to lead many scientists to view philosophers as proto-scientists rather than the more complex thought pioneers and concept creators that they are. Notable exceptions to this would include Albert Einstein who cited inspiration from and exhibited a competent understanding of Spinoza.",1413687314

8477071,comment,8475995,8475995,0,0,joshgel,,,"I&#x27;m a medical resident at a prestigious teaching hospital. I hate to admit it, but I&#x27;ve lost my empathy already.<p>The experience most interns have on day 1 is a massive increase in responsibility and work load as compared to medical school. Whereas most medical students in their 4th year &quot;manage&quot; (under the very close supervision of residents) 2, 3, or maybe 4 patients, on day 1 of intern year they are suddenly expected to be responsible for upwards of 10-12 patients (under supervision, but considerably less supervision than med students). Interns go from spending most of their time studying and learning medicine, to being suddenly, constantly busy with often mind-numbing tasks. We interns joke that we are nothing more than secretaries, doing tasks for our boses all day without time to sit down and think for ourselves, despite the M.D. we just spent years earning. Eventually, we get better at prioritizing, we learn the system, and we learn by doing.<p>But, early in intern year, we can&#x27;t prioritize, we don&#x27;t know the system, frankly we can&#x27;t even keep which patient is which straight in our heads. But, regardless, we still have n number of tasks to do by the end of the day.<p>Spending extra time talking to patients isn&#x27;t part of n. Empathy isn&#x27;t an item in n. Figuring out a patient&#x27;s priorities for their health aren&#x27;t an item. Those are extras.<p>And to get home on time, after my 12-14 hour shift, all I have to do is my list of n tasks, which is substantial. So, we quickly learned that long conversations with patients are the enemy of getting home on time. And pretty quickly, we start to eliminate those conversations. Then, we figure out that other things patients need, like empathy, a careful history taking and detailed physical exam, family discussions, etc also stand in our way of getting our work done on time.<p>Eventually, we learn the ability to keep our patient&#x27;s complex medical problems straight and become much more efficient at getting our work done quickly. So, realizing we have more time, some of us go back and start to do the things that really matter to patients, like those things listed above and in the article. But, we&#x27;ve already learned, or forced by the system to learn, that we can get away with not doing those things, so as soon as we get a little extra busy or are a little extra tired, those are the first things we skip.<p>Then, suddenly, we start second year and can now be asked to work 24-28 hours straight, and now we have 18-24 patients instead of 10-12 that we are responsible for and the system again drains us of the very thing we enrolled in medical school to be.",1413687275

By coincidence, two incubators are in town giving talks and opportunities for students to pitch. I emailed one of the groups and set up a pitch, despite them running out of slots. At first I was excited but then I began to feel like we were moving too fast.<p>After talking to my co-founder I decided to cancel the pitch. We felt like pitching at this stage would be too early since we we weren&#x27;t blocked by anything and we knew what to do next. We decided that it would be more advantageous to wait until we finish building everything.<p>What do you think? Is it ever too early to pitch your ideas to VCs/incubators?",1413687085

8477064,comment,8475809,8475809,0,0,mamcx,,,"So, I read about the fast interpreter and small language. How do something like this?<p>&quot;Whitney’s strategy was to implement a core of the language – including the bits everyone thought most difficult, the operators and nested arrays – and use that to implement the rest of the language. The core was to be written in self-expanding C. As far as I know, the kdb+ interpreter is built the same way.<p>Unlike the tall skinny C programs in the textbooks, the code for this interpreter spills sideways across the page. It certainly doesn’t look like C.&quot;<p>This mean that the code is very unreadable C? Like a kind of code-golf?<p>How replicate it for built a speedy interpreter?

You just only remember the good parts of the old episodes because of the fallibility of human memory. This selective memory makes the good old days seem better then they were.<p>I would have to disagree here. I grew up watching post-season-9 or so episodes, mostly the new episodes each Sunday night. If I was lucky, I might see an older episode like &quot;30 Minutes Over Tokyo&quot; when it got rerun and I happened to tune in to a weekday episode, and I enjoyed them a lot. (This was long before I became a hardened torrenter.)  Then the DVD box sets starting coming out and I asked for them as gifts; season 1, season 2 - these were revelations to me, I had <i>never</i> seen any of them before. (Fox didn&#x27;t rebroadcast them, or I missed them.) And they were clearly very different from the newer episodes, and I thought by and large they were better.",1413684367

8477003,comment,8472157,8476760,0,0,rquantz,,,"I actually don&#x27;t think we completely disagree here.<p>First, I definitely didn&#x27;t intend the parallels with math to extend any further than the problems of perception with regard to how they are taught versus how they are practiced by scholars. Music theory is an art-related discipline and very much culturally inflected.<p>And this makes sense. Most music theory (in the West at least?) does focus on Western classical music, in large part because Western music has a literate tradition (see Taruskin) that most other musical traditions lack, which allows us to treat the compositions themselves as texts/objects more easily than other musics.<p>Even within Western music, we tend to use style- (read culture-) specific analytical tools. It doesn&#x27;t make sense to use harmonic analysis for Stravinsky, and it doesn&#x27;t make sense to look for twelve-tone rows in Mozart. In general we use a combination of language that composers used and thought with (so for Mozart, think keys and counterpoint) and techniques that arose from observing the style after the fact (in this case, for instance, sonata form, or Schenkerian analysis).<p>All of these techniques are culturally biased because, as you&#x27;ve pointed out several times, music is psychological, and therefore rooted in culture. Meanwhile, it makes sense to analyze, for instance, Indian classical music using rhythmic modes.<p>So, coming around to your analogy with elementary school grammar education, I think you&#x27;re right that there is a prescriptivist parallel here -- learning that parallel fifths are not allowed, or that the second theme in a sonata always modulates to the dominant, or even that there always is a second theme in sonata, all of these do not accurately describe all music, or even all Western music of the common practice period. They are artifacts of the particular techniques being used. The original description of the sonata came into being around the same time as prescriptivist grammar (and has had a great deal of improvement since then -- read Rosen if you haven&#x27;t already). Species counterpoint and Bach-style chorale harmonizing came about to describe specific styles, and to be used as exercises for composition students in the 18th-19th Centuries. The fact that those two things in particular (which I think are the most grievous examples of what you&#x27;re talking about) are still included in music theory education is possibly counterproductive, especially since they are treated as sets of rules, rather than as historical examples of the composition pedagogy that the Western classical composers themselves were subjected to. Teaching Fux as anything other than &quot;this is how Mozart and Beethoven learned to write counterpoint&quot; is silly.<p>So that&#x27;s the prescriptivist parts. However, where we disagree is that I think there&#x27;s still a lot here that&#x27;s useful for <i>descriptive</i> purposes. It&#x27;s difficult to talk about classical music within its cultural-intellectual context, which I think is necessary, without these tools. You can argue that any interval can be dissonant with the right timbre, but if those timbres are rarely used in the repertoire you&#x27;re describing, it&#x27;s not much use is it? The 18th and 19th Century composers thought about dissonance a certain way, and if you&#x27;re analyzing their work as art objects (cultural objects) rather than physical objects, you have to at least take that into account.",1413684198
