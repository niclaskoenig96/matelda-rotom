Immature brats who think they&#x27;re hot because somebody gave them money and a foosball table. Pretty sure I&#x27;ll never work for a startup again unless it&#x27;s my own.<p>I worked for a startup in River North for a year or so. My manager (later VP) insisted we use his custom ORM. Fine. I needed to join two tables. I ran out of memory trying to process the result sets in memory. I needed a database join. Every morning&#x27;s stand-up, same story &quot;I&#x27;m blocked until the ORM implements joins. Want me to implement them?&quot; &quot;No, I don&#x27;t want you touching that code.&quot; So him & his minion would pace around and scribble on a white board all day, then go out for drinks. Next morning, same thing. So after two weeks of surfing the web because I&#x27;m blocked on everything I&#x27;m supposed to be working on, I just write a SQL query with a join and finish my damn component. He sees my commit, makes everybody stop working while he chews me out in front of everyone for not using the ORM. &quot;Does it do joins yet?&quot; &quot;No, BUT IT&#x27;S GOING TO!&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s so much easier to berate your employees than have a solid architecture, use existing libraries, write unit tests, or have any sort of plan. Say you &quot;move fast and break things&quot; to the press, then scream at someone that &quot;this isn&#x27;t a game&quot; when things break.<p>I&#x27;m a manager myself now, and I make it a point to have the kind of environment where failures become learning experiences and the first place I put blame is on our process. I&#x27;ve seen average developers become stars by being honest about how they screwed up, then sending them down the right path. But I&#x27;m in my late thirties now. My management style comes from studying leadership and almost two decades of development experience under good & bad managers. These startup managers were all in their mid-twenties. I wonder what training, what mentoring they had. I sometimes think they were just copying every stereotypical boss they saw on TV.",1448254473

It does not depend upon a particular medium for its expression.<p>> As it happens, cognitive neuroscience research from the past two decades or so has begun to lift the veil on where language is processed in the brain. The short answer is that it is everywhere.<p>> Why is it that today, only humans have language, the most complex of animal behaviours?<p>> [Early humans&#x27;] new ecological situation would have led, inexorably, to changes in human behaviour. ... This allows us to picture the emergence of language as a gradual process from many overlapping tendencies.<p>> We see this instinct [(cooperation)] at work in human infants as they attempt to acquire their mother tongue. Children have far more sophisticated learning capacities than Chomsky foresaw. They are able to deploy sophisticated intention-recognition abilities from a young age, perhaps as early as nine months old, in order to begin to figure out the communicative purposes of the adults around them.

My other son played with a girl who was a tomboy because they liked rough and tumble and both gave as good as they got.<p>There are so many ways that young kids can identify strong characteristics, even at 5 years old.  I can&#x27;t guarantee they won&#x27;t change (although my kids haven&#x27;t changed as far as I can recall).<p>The first incident I remember (while not gender related) was my son when he was 6 months old.  He HATED scratchy fabric from the scarf from a bear.  We had to cut the scarf and the tag off this bear.  Over a decade later, he still has that same fussiness with fabrics.  This tells me that some preferences are there from a very young age.<p>I could very well imagine some kids feeling at odds with their birth gender from a very young age.",1448251289
