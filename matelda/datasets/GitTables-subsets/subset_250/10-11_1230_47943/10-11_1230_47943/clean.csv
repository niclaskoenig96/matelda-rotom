I hate to say it, but I think the the article is spot on.  I lived most of my life in Canada, moved to Japan for 5 years, moved again to the UK for 2 years and have now moved back to Japan (hopefully for good).<p>Japanese culture is drilled into people at school.  This is something heavily criticised by foreigners who pity the lack of freedom that Japanese school children have.  It is a double edged sword, but this strong cultural upbringing (enforced by teachers, not parents) does have a lot of advantages.<p>I think one of the biggest thing I like about Japan is the lack of societal angst that I perceive here.  Many, many people here are &quot;poor&quot; (I live in the countryside where jobs are <i>not</i> plentiful, or high paying), but I never hear anyone complaining about their salary.  You just make do with what you have.  Especially the &quot;American Dream&quot; is practically absent.  Hardly anybody tries to strike it rich.  They just try to make a nice life within their means.<p>When I lived in the UK, the sky rocketing housing market split people into 2 camps -- those speculating in order to make it rich, and those who were wondering if how they were going to be able to live on the pittance of a salary they received (and complaining about the injustice of it all).<p>I&#x27;m sure many people prefer the western approach, but I will happily live in &quot;poverty&quot; in Japan instead.",1426847477
