220762,comment,220720,220752,0,0,fiaz,,,"I think this is a valid point and what strikes me as most interesting about it is that we are indeed entering into a time where technology is increasingly becoming a commodity.  Perhaps this is the wrong place to be making such a claim (given that this is ""Hacker News""), but I believe that the connections that emerge from such enabling technology as reddit's is more important than the underlying implementations that create such connections.<p>It's also useful to mention that the user experience that is embodied in reddit's code is pretty specific to reddit the site.  While others might want to create their own reddits, they are merely distributing reddit's user experience to the rest of the internet.  What would be interesting to me is if the specific user experience is morphed into a new user experience, instead of merely repackaging it into something that looks different.",1213797511
220761,comment,220597,220597,0,0,ericb,,,"Encouraging startups is a good direction to look for improving society; it plays to our strengths and encourages value creation. Unlike the current administration, I think Obama's administration would take an open mind about how best to aid startups.<p>I'd be most interested in a low-doc corporation. For example, don't make me pay estimated taxes, payroll, etc, except once a year. Give me a simplified tax setup that's brainless. Don't make me file a pointless annual report to please the gov't.",1213797463

220759,comment,220597,220597,0,0,gruseom,,,"What's interesting about the article is not the article but the quote in its first sentence: Barack Obama ""proposes eliminating capital gains taxes on start-up companies"". Is that not astonishing? I hadn't heard it before. It's indicative of how deep Obama's connections are in the Valley.<p>As for what the article calls the ""obvious problem"" with the idea (""the tax lawyers will have every company in America defined as a start-up""), what a lame point. The same objection could be made to any policy or any legislation. I think Obama's dismissive answer to this is right (he basically said, duh, we'll write the definitions competently).",1213797326

I like the arrow navigation (though you have to click IN to the content to scroll down, as opposed to just moving the container ever so slightly down).  Slick.  But, there are lots of things I don't like.<p>1. What is that domain name?  What am I missing?  It tells me nothing and will not help your site grown in anyway.<p>2. Show me, right on the front page, what you mean.  I know what a slide show is, SHOW ME what your app does.  This isn't that hard, but I want to see it more than read it.  Give me an image of a browser window with the next content to the right and the last to the left.  I like pictures.<p>3. Get rid of the word ""test"" all over your home page.  Seriously, it should not be there.  Put some real content (even if it's just testing content!) in there so I don't see how young you are.<p>4. Man, I hate registering for things.  Probably not what you want to hear, but do I have to register/login?  Can't you just use a cookie to identify me and link me with my list(s) on your end?  I'd love to just work as a guest of sorts - forever.",1213796706

220746,comment,220390,220574,0,0,natrius,,,"The linked article gives a good justification for not purchasing such tests to begin with, but it doesn't suggest that they should be outlawed.<p>You suggest that someone will get these tests done, then go to their doctor and ask what they can do about the results. I see absolutely no problem with that. You say that even doctors don't know how to evaluate conflicting results from these tests, but why is that a problem? Someone will go to their doctor and their doctor will tell them the test is meaningless. Even if people who got these tests done overused the healthcare system, it should still be allowed. These are private doctors and private insurance plans. Perhaps Medicare shouldn't cover further evaluations that are the result of such a test.<p>I fear for the future of our society when the belief that one should be able to obtain any desired information about oneself is referred to as a ""simplistic interpretation of personal liberty"".

He defines cutting taxes as ""government intervention"" and keeping taxes as ""letting the market work."" That's news to me.<p>2) He assumes that the average new business owner will create a ""startup."" First, the policy mentioned in the WSJ doesn't give a definition of startup, and neither does he (although he mentions the problem). And second, if a small business isn't a ""startup,"" what is it?<p>3) Of course economic growth is inversly correlated with self-employment. It's because most people suck at owning a business. But to leave in economic barriers to reduce failure is a dumb idea.<p>4) He claims that ""government intervention"" by lowering cap gains taxes would encourage competition in areas that have low barriers to entry. I thought that was the point.<p>5) The first article he cites showing the negative correlation between firm age and productivity comes from a paper in <i>1999</i>.(<a href=""http://www.jstor.org/pss/117087"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jstor.org/pss/117087</a>). Bad data.<p>6) The second piece of evidence he cites pulls data from 1975 - 1996. Once again, bad data. And if he's talking about tech startups, then he should isolate that data to draw the proper correlation<p>This isn't about bias or politics. This is about an article full of bullshit. Either it was poorly written or he tried to take a conclusion and started selectively looking for evidence to support it.",1213794452
