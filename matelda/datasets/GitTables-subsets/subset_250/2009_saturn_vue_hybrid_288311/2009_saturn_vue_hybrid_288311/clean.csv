4.875,Vue living up to mileage claims,Mark ,09/24/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,5,5,"I have over 40,000 miles on my 2009 Vue Hybrid. Absolutely no problems and I am averaging 28.6 mpg.  I like the way it looks and rides.  Too bad it is not being continued.",Mileage and handling and feel,If it were possible to redesign make the cargo area a little bigger.
2.625,Disappointed Vue Driver,rick ,07/21/2010,,,2,4,3,3,,2,3,2,2,"Purchased in the Cash For Clunkers program last summer. Looking for a reasonable choice in SUV's. Looking for decent mileage combined with utility. Vue is very good looking, receive frequent compliments. Mileage has never lived up to expectations. Blame  pitiful 4 speed automatic.  Can't keep up with interstate traffic or cruise any hills at speed. Constantly pushing it to downshift to stay with traffic.  Should have waited for the 4cyl Equinox. Lost cell phone to a drink buried in the deep well cup holder. Sliding arm rest won't stay in forward. Front door won't stay open on incline.  Considering getting out of ASAP, even if it means taking a loss. (Hybrid battery pack failed at 17,000 mi)",Exterior looks.,"With Saturn out of the business, no need to offer suggestion, but would like to have seen a modern (six speed at least) transmission.  Console/arm rest on same level as seats.  Power tailgate, roof rails."
4.875,European Styling and Engineering,Jack D. ,04/03/2010,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,4,5,"Love the vehicle. First Hybrid. Work for Car Rental company. Tried Escape Hybrid, Altima Hybrid, Prius. Previous 03 VUE trade in. V-6, AWD. The suspension on these VUE`s is excellent, and it survives mileage. Alignment is important. Love the independent suspension design. Now, that Saturn is gone, will go to Chevy Equinox, or GMC Midsize SUV.  Waiting on Hybrid and hope, AWD. Interior is eye catching, durable.","Hybrid, A/C, Satellite Radio, Electric Driver`s seat. Quietness inside at highway speed, visibility. I am tall. Quicksilver paint and upholstery. Excellent. Dashboard lighting is great, computer system is GM excellent. Same as Malibu, Aura, Silverado, Tahoe.  Easy to follow.","Bring back Saturn dealers, AWD Saturn VUE Hybrids. Or make Chevy Equinox the same size and style, not the present bigger style (2010). "
3,Hybrid System Questionable,Mickey ,03/09/2010,,,4,4,2,2,,2,4,2,4,"I had a Honda Hybrid so I went with the supposed reliability of a Saturn Hybrid. The Service Hybrid light came on unexpectedly several months after buying it and hybrid system was not working.Took it to dealer and the Hybrid battery had a leak. Battery was replaced. Now 5 months later hybrid light back on and Red battery light came on, showing hybrid system not working and battery not charging at all. Other than long commutes on hwy, city driving mpg was poor at about 20- 21 mpg. Should be better. I now question the cars reliability?",Overall vehicle design is great. I have the sun roof and heated leather seats which are great on my bad back. Other features inside are good as well.,Dome light button needs to be lighted. I can't find it in the dark. need to consider a spare tire. Worried if I get a flat far from home.
5,Home run for Saturn!,AstroGeek ,11/04/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"As this was my first Saturn and my first hybrid purchase, I did considerable research before finally buying. I knew to expect a pretty decent crossover, but this little Vue Hybrid has exceeded every expectation! Being German-born and raised, I appreciate the smart, no- nonsense, 'European' interior styling -  no useless fluff or silly eye candy here. The exterior is truly gorgeous; it grabs your attention unlike earlier Vues or most competitive offerings. Mileage so far has been outstanding: 1900+ miles driven on 3 1/2 18-gallon tanks of gas! Stop-and-go city driving is returning 25-28 MPG and highway 38- 40. In fact, with cruise engaged at 65 MPH, I easily top 42 MPG on level roads. Bravo GM!","Styling: interior & exterior are simply beautiful. Rock-solid build quality (sounds Mercedes-like when doors are shut!). Power sunroof is terrific, as are the XM radio, Bluetooth, and leather seating. Superb gas mileage. Fun manual shifter. Plenty of space in console, glove box, & behind rear seats.",2-Mode Hybrid would have been a welcome option for slightly improved city mileage. 6-speed tranny (available with the non-hybrid 6-cyl engine) plus a few extra ponies would have been great for a bit better acceleration. 1-year free subscription to XM rather than 3 months also would have been nice.
3,Hybrid Shamybrid,no-ybrid ,09/18/2009,,,4,5,3,1,,2,4,1,4,"Ok, so here is the deal with any car, its like the lotto you have a very small chance of getting a lemon, and yes I guess I must have got one. Avg 20 MPG combined, with optimal settings per the book. Took to dealer service, they stated anything from 20-30 was ok, and that it could take up to 4K miles to break in the engine, bullony I read the whole manual and advised the service manager that per the manual it says if the car stands for 3 months it can cause major damage to the hybrid battery and, my car was sitting at the dealer lot for 8 months and only got 60 miles, so he agreed to replace it, we will see what happens, I hope this resolves the problem.  waiting to see savings....","in my car performance stinks, interior is nice, and exterior look is nice, that's why we got it but this whole MPG thing has made all of the pros not look so great any more...","obviously Quality control is not top priority for Saturn, they need to check each hybrid system, and come up with a better computer system that can notify the user when something is wrong with the charging or battery output systems, per what I could gather its basically engine light when it fails..."
4.625,so far so good,tom m ,09/08/2009,,,5,5,4,5,,4,4,5,5,"Traded in my envoy to get this hybrid, and I am glad I did, getting 28 mpg around town, and over 32 on the highway, its pretty much a smooth, quiet ride, didn't really pay a premium for getting a hybrid, as Saturn was offering $3,000.00 off the msrp, in addition to other discounts. Very happy with the car","the mpg gauge(average, and instant), all four individual tire gauge, hands free phone, xm radio, super large glove box","better tires,,,,,,,,read some very bad reviews on the goodyear invicta tires that come with the vehicle"
4.625,"The ""honeymoon"" review",bowmanspartan ,06/24/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,4,5,4,4,"So far, the Vue Hybrid is a head- turner. A gorgeous car that is very comfortable to ride in. Quiet ride and a real gas-sipper (I got nearly 35 mpg on average with the cruise control on 75 and the AC on full-blast heading down I-94 here in MI).  The performance is not bad (but I do sometimes miss my V6 Escape Limited), especially when you know how to use the electronic manual shift options. The car is pretty nimble at higher speeds (and if you need a boost, just drop the gear down). My only gripe is that the car doesn't really have much oomph 'off the line'. But it's a Hybrid, not a Maserati. I'm considering altering the intake to help with this, but for now it does just fine.  ","Styling. Interior and Exterior are gorgeous. Seems to be a very sturdy build, lots of room. ","Stereo seems a bit underpowered, but nothing major. Steering can be squishy sometimes when you're in tight spots (car handles well, but seems like the wheel turns forever). Could use about +20hp at the wheels. "
5,VUE Hybrid Better than expected,Cloverp ,05/19/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"I bought the VUE Hybrid 2 months ago and it has been a wonderful vehicle for me. Before I bought the VUE, I was worried about the engine power, but it has the same pickup as any 6 cylinder engine vehicle I have ever driven. The gas mileage is great. I average between 27 and 29mpg with stop and go country driving. On the highway with a full load of people, it will get above 30mpg easy. Lots of space for a smaller SUV. Drives extremely smooth. Very nice design.",I really like the way it looks and the gas mileage and the interior space.,A short person has trouble seeing out the back windows. Display controls need to be more accessible.
5,Best Value...,B&NC ,05/01/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,5,5,"Went to Hybrid to save fuel and help America. Enjoy the Saturn VUE Hybrid, since it offers more in terms of other Hybrids. The workmanship of vehicle is outstanding, with pleasant comforts, and automatic features. Leather seats are comfortable, and hold the body in position. Great handling in steering, and great acceleration if needed, mileage has been outstanding at 34mpg highway on occasion 30 to 32 regularly, and average 27mpg city. ","Feature liked best  everything. Vehicle has been very well thought out.Love the automatic wipers which come on when windshield is getting rained on, automatic lights are a plus, heated seats are therapeutic, especially on long drives. The phone/On-Star system is clear and easy to use-hands free.","Concerned over no spare, but have On- Star, and road side service. My dealer put hydrogen gas in tires which will take more time to leak in the even I run over something.  I would also like to see auto dim side view mirrors and rearview mirror,  had that in the past and a great feature. "
4.625,First week of ownership,graybeeker ,04/04/2009,,,5,5,5,5,,5,5,2,5,"This is the first hybrid vehicle that I have owned. The vehicle has alot of plus's about it. But, for now I will only comment on a negative about the vehicle. After driving the vehicle for 3 days out of 7 we have an average of 11-13.5 mpg. That is with all the settings for the best fuel economy for this vehicle. We are not happy about the very low MPG. We are going to drive the usual amount next week and then recheck the MPG. There are good things about the vehicle. Easy to drive, comfort the driver and front passenger are very good. There is OnStar in the vehicle, XM Radio, and alot of other features. One more week to test it. If it does not measure up then back to the dealer. ",,
2.375,Hybrid Battery Failure,unhappy owner ,03/24/2009,,,3,3,3,1,,1,3,2,3,"I purchased the 2009 green-line hybrid VUE.  What a mistake! I have owned the car for less than six months and  the hybrid battery system has been replaced twice!  The first failure came at 90 days after purchase, and now the second failure is 80 days after the first.  My mileage has been only 18-20 city and 24 hgwy.  Do not buy this car. ",,
4.375,2009 Saturn Vue Hybrid,spicoli ,02/19/2009,,,4,5,5,5,,3,4,5,4,I purchased the vehicle in January 2009 and put 3500 on it during a three week period during a trip from Ohio to Florida with no problems whatsoever. Base model includes many extras and the five point chrome rims are a plus. Great exterior looks and styling make this vehicle very appealing. I am pleased with the vehicle thus far and really have no major complaints other than it seems like they have put a lower wattage stereo in the hybrid models. I have driven numerous rental cars with this same radio and they have all outperformed the version in the hybrid. ,XM radio. Chrome rims. Bluetooth. Fuel economy. Exterior looks. Quiet ride,Lighted overhead buttons. More high end torque. Spare tire. Higher wattage stereo
4.25,My Commuter Car,Jim ,11/21/2008,,,4,5,4,4,,4,4,5,4,Well I recently purchased my Vue hybbrid to help me lower my fuel costs. I have to drive 270 miles a day round trip for my job. I needed a vehicle that was roomy enough for me and woulld improve my mpg's. Most of my trip is on the highway. This vehicle has cut my fuel costs in half. I was getting about 14MPG in my Jeep GC and am now getting 31MPG in the vue hybrid. I live in the Catskill mountains of New York  and have to drive down to the office in New Jersey. This vehicle has done well even in the mountains. I hope the vehicle will be reliable considering the high mileage I will be putting on it. About 1200 miles a week.,So far I enjoy everything about the vue. Although my favorite feature would have to the amount of MPG it gets on the highway...31+,Wish it had self dimming rear view and drivers side mirror. Also wish the steering wheel was telescopic.
4.625,Saturn Vue Hybrid,Mike ,11/12/2008,,,5,4,5,5,,4,5,5,4,"I needed a vehicle that could go camping and also would work in town and on the freeway.  Some of the import hybrids were good in town, but felt strained on the freeway, and couldn't go on dirt roads. I get 28 MPG with 90% city driving and 30+ MPG on the freeway. Good engine that have variable cam timing and will rev to 6,900 if you need extra acceleration.  Love the car.  Like OnStar a lot.   ","Good mileage along with good freeway power and mileage.  Plus, made in the USA.",Great car.
4.625,Nice vehicle,Jim C. ,10/07/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,4,5,4,"GM includes nearly all options on the hybrid model. I added sunroof and leather seats. Nice looking inside and out.  Comfortable to drive. Power from the 2.4L 4 cylinder engine is fine for everyday driving and results in the following gas mileage. 24~26mpg around town, 32~38mpg at 55mph, 29~30mpg at 70mph.  Even though this is a gas sipping green car, I like the agressive styling including 17"" chrome alloy rims.  I have someone ask about it just about everytime I stop for gas, especially from owners of big SUVs.","Mileage for a vehicle this size, Driver Info computer with tire pressure, MPG, etc. Mild hybrid system. Interior looks and features, exterior looks","Nice vehicle as is. Sure there are features that could be added.  But, nothing needs to be fixed on this vehicle."
4.5,Great vehicle,Jim ,09/28/2008,,,5,5,5,5,,4,4,4,4,"Comfortable power for everyday driving, merging into highway traffic and pulling the usual highway uphill grades. My mileage : In town  24 - 26 mpg 55 mile per hour highway  37 mpg 65 mile per hour highway  33 mpg. Styling is sharp inside and out. I like that even though this thing is a hybrid with low rolling resistance tires, GM still gave it sporty styling including sharp 17 inch alloy spoke wheels. Fully equiped, cruise, power everything, nice digital display for mileage, temperature, tire presssure, etc. It's a great vehicle, performs well. Love the engine start/stop mild hybrid system. Works smoothly, practical and low cost!","Great fuel economy for vehicle this size, appearance inside and out, Driver Information Center (DIC), fold flat rear seats for cargo room, nicely equipped.",Increase reclining ability of rear seats. Move the DIC controls to the steering wheel. Add illuminated buttons to the dome light controls to make it easier to find in the dark.
