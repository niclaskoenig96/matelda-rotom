Crimes happen all the time; they&#x27;re commmitted by people who then try very hard to hide what they did.<p>So a criminal investigator is going to treat everyone they interview with suspicion from the start. That suspicion is not a personal failing any more than a software QA tester who doesn&#x27;t trust the latest build. It&#x27;s inherent in that type of job.<p>And investigators only have certain tools that they can use in order to find the criminals who are lying to them. If they get information the wrong way, even if it is accurate information about a real crime, it will be ruled inadmissable and the criminal will get away.<p>A big tool they have is relationships. If they can get one person in a criminal network to cooperate, then they can try to traverse the network and find the other criminals. Since criminals rarely <i>want</i> to cooperate with law enforcement, they use &quot;gotcha&quot; type tools to compel cooperation--like the false statement trap.

But let me see what I can remember.<p>The big thing about VB is the obvious one: it was really easy to get started using it, and despite the flaws in the visual environment and the language itself, it was good enough to get things done.<p>In fact, Basic was a lot better than the language we were originally going to put in, which was barely more than a glorified batch language (and not even as powerful as .bat).<p>The idea we had at the beginning was that you&#x27;d drag an arrow on the screen from one component to another, signifying that an event triggered on the first component would make an action happen on the other. This is where the phrase &quot;fire an event&quot; came from: I was looking for a verb for this, and &quot;trigger&quot; didn&#x27;t sound right. I was frustrated and had a bunch of rubber bands on the table, so I started firing them at the screen. That didn&#x27;t help. So I fired up a doobie, and between flicking the lighter and firing the rubber bands, &quot;fire an event&quot; seemed like the phrase to use.<p>What worked well in VBX? Well again it was fairly simple to use and easy for people to make extensions with. The big disaster was that it was pretty much tied into the Win16 programming model, so when Windows moved to 32 bits, VBX wasn&#x27;t going to cut it and Microsoft developed OCX to replace it.",1426736854

A big part of the issue is the light spectrum and distribution of it.  There is a pretty easy way to test / verify this, if you have an eye chart handy.  Compare your acuity in outdoor, shaded light, to a solely fluorescent lit environment.  Once you get to where you can barely make out the line, note the difference in acuity natural vs. artificial light.<p>Also, the minus lens creates focal plane stimulus inside the eye that prompts axial elongation.  Lots of studies on this subject, it&#x27;s basically uncontested.  What you really don&#x27;t want to be doing is wear a lens that gives you sharp distance vision, while working up close.  You want to have a specific reduced prescription for close-up, that just gives you correction to the distance you need.<p>Breaks, also.  Initial myopia is a ciliary (focusing muscle) spasm.  Lots of studies there too, look for pseudo myopia or NITM (near induced transient myopia).  Part of your current deficiency is ciliary, part is axial elongation.  Take an hour break every three hours.  Get outside.  Focus at a distance.  Your ciliary muscle isn&#x27;t meant to be all tensed up (close-up use) all day.<p>For more on the subject, take a look at www.frauenfeldclinic.com, those guys are fairly awesome.",1426736356

Another project had been started in Visual C++ 6 and upgraded multiple times over the years.

People also tend to have strongly held preferences in the build system department - it&#x27;s a bit like text editors.  I tend to view it as problem-dependent as to which system is better.  If you&#x27;re all java, you probably want a build tool designed for that language (for example.)  Lisp has asdf and friends.  My focus (cross platform C/C++ building) has led me to deal with autotools and CMake.  I prefer CMake for 3 major reasons:  1) self contained - you just install CMake itself and you can handle all sorts of things (tar.bz2 decompression, file copying, directory creation, etc.) automatically and portably.  No need to first install Python or Perl or... whatever for Windows.  From a Linux/*BSD perspective, developing on Windows is like crossing the Sahara - you need to carry your own supplies.  CMake packs a lot into a small, self contained package.  2) Learn one language and you&#x27;re done.  Would it have been better to go with something like lua?  Probably, in hindsight (my opinion).  However, compared to the mind bending complexity that is sh + m4 + automake + autoconf + ... CMake is (in my experience) quite a lot easier to get a handle on.  3) Wide support for many platforms/tools  (Visual Studio, Xcode, ninja, make, Eclipse, etc.) from one common set of build definitions.  The maintenance savings really add up if you need to support all those tools - Hunt and Thomas&#x27;s DRY principle in action.",1426735466

The core value I was going to build my solution around was by incorporating / generating examples from real code.  Rather than being docs that were published it would almost be close to a code search engine.  While the developers are lazy and rarely document you could bootstrap the documentation by finding example usage in the wild and presenting it and from there allow the users annotate it (and the developers if they ever get around to it).<p>There are many problems with todays docs, another one that is missing has to be analytics.   If I own an API I want to know what users are constantly looking at and discussing so that I can make that part better, less confusing, etc.  And conversely if there are no example usage and no one has ever looked at an API that would be useful to know too as it could be code that could be ripped out and no longer maintained.  What api are users searching for, but never find?  There is more, but these are just a few off the top of my head.<p>By generating content rather than relying on the developers to sign up and publish the site would explode in size and utility.  Think Yahoo directory v.s. Google ala 1998.<p>The idea that someone would generate static html files and put them somewhere is almost barbaric compared to the richness that could be provided.<p>Unfortunately I don&#x27;t really have a financial story to go with this idea.  One was to be free for open source projects and charge for commercial.  But honestly more likely would be that I would build it for a few years and then someone like Facebook would just call me up and buy it out to shut it down and solve their API documentation problems.  Not saying that is bad, but I would have to make it until that would happen and I would prefer to have found another solution than a aquirehire end game.",1426734297

I figured it was appropriate for our community, but I got nervous when there was little uptake at first.  Thankfully, after a few hours, it was on the front page, which restored my confidence.  I&#x27;ll keep an eye out for more useful stuff.<p>Incidentally, I realized that my GP statement might make people think I work at the NSF, and I don&#x27;t.  I work at Ohio Supercomputer Center and this was announced to us via an internal mailing list.",1426734272

Biking to work is best when there are no cars on the road at all, or when they are bumper to bumper, moving in small 15 km/h bursts (in which situation I can treat them as de facto standing objects).<p>Also, small narrow streets where cars have to go slow are better than big wide lanes.<p>Part of this proposal is about improving the road infrastructure which is about, doh, <i>more cars, moving faster</i>.  Faster commute times are promised to drivers and transit riders alike.<p>Also, transit buses present a particular threat to me: they always pull over to the right, cutting me off so that I have to swerve left around them into traffic. Almost daily, some bus driver races ahead of me and then cuts me off, even though I&#x27;m faster on average, and if he just gave me a few seconds, I would be out of there and he&#x27;d never see me again. If I vote Yes, I&#x27;m saying I want more of these jerks out there trying to kill me.",1426734248

Two questions for you.<p>VB and Hypercard get a lot of nostalgic love these days, and a lot of people (including ITT) maintain there aren&#x27;t any real successors to them.<p>What would you consider to be the standout merits to Ruby/VB that ought to be reproduced now?<p>Second question, since plugins and dynamic extension are never out of style: in the VBX interface, what did you think worked well, and what did you think was a tremendous disaster?<p>Thanks!",1426734127

The cop was asking me a bunch of questions about why I was driving so fast, and I just played it off like I didn&#x27;t understand, just trying to say as little as possible. It was a bad tactic - it raised suspicion and I later learned that my mother thought I was actually holding drugs or something because I was being evasive. I still in general agree with the advice, but... it requires some subtlety.",1426734047
