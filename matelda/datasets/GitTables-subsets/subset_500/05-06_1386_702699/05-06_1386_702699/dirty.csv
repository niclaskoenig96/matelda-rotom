7952883,comment,7937476,7939202,2,0,hueving,,,">Yeah, DUI should disqualify you from ever driving professionally IMO. Anecdotal, sure, but my experience is that people who actually have a DUI are the ones that finally got caught after years.<p>What you are implying is that once someone drives drunk they will never stop. If that&#x27;s the case, they should be stripped of their license completely. It doesn&#x27;t make sense to stop half way and say they can keep driving themselves but can&#x27;t drive professionally. Both scenarios put many people at risk.",1403848767

It&#x27;s just one PR department relaying a message from another PR dept.<p>It&#x27;s all the US. It&#x27;s all the current system. Yes, the constitution has been drastically weakened by money interests. Yes.<p>I went to Austin, TX a couple weeks back to be my Brother&#x27;s best man. I didn&#x27;t realize he was marrying a cop&#x27;s daughter in a rural area outside the city limits, because all he told me about the guy was he&#x27;s a skydiver. I fly paragliders, so I figured we had a lot in common.<p>There&#x27;s a really good reason all the souveneirs in the area say &quot;Austin City Limits&quot;!

You really, really shouldn&#x27;t.<p>Within an hour of getting to the house, I got in a minor verbal spat with my own sister. My ridiculous mother decided to call the police department to ingratiate herself with my brother&#x27;s new family. Well, I&#x27;m 150 lbs (but still pretty tough) and a 270 lb gorilla showed up to learn me some manners about how to act when in Rome.<p>He practiced some Krav Maga on me, probably something he just learned and was aching to demonstrate. He twisted my carpal tunnels around, bend my injured knees around a bit, damaged nerves in my left hip and left wrist. Stood on my scoliosis, stretched a tendon in my left shoulder....<p>And then the police department itself put me in a hospital! I could have walked it off in a couple hours, but the cops run this hospital. They have the doctors and orderlies continue to be very abusive so as to keep you in shock for days (5 for me) and then they try to have a doctor threaten you with institutionalization because you had a delusion about police persecution!<p>That&#x27;s their system, and apparently the Red Staters really truly like it that way. Keeps the outsiders and Mexicans out! Or so these fools think. They think they can keep the Mexicans out! They&#x27;ll be in for quite the shock themselves when they find out Rupert Murdoch has been lying.<p>And that it&#x27;s them that have to learn spanish after all.

We do so because we believe that spaced repetition learning did by far not yet get the attention from learners that it deserves and if you don&#x27;t know it and don&#x27;t like our colors, then by all means please try a competitor&#x27;s product to see what you&#x27;ve been missing back at school/university.<p>To get to mass adoption we strongly believe that content creation has to be crowd-sourced and that is why one of the most unique features is shared ownership, allowing concurrent content creation and editing while others are learning. Rich feedback on the use of the content, including feedback on single card performances will help content creators to improve cards to make their cardsets ever better.<p>Lastly, if you have technical questions, just ask. The most basic might be our software stack (playframework, jquery, bootstrap, touchpunch, mongo) and our collaborative tools (git on bitbucket, kunagi).",1403846567

There has <i>not</i> been sufficient work in hardening Docker to ensure that there are no way of breaking out of Docker containers.<p>> I consider that an ugly hack that should be avoided at all costs. Why? It&#x27;s not viable without up-front automation investment,<p>There are multiple automation tools available that can handle KVM just fine, including OpenStack. And if you&#x27;re going to be deploying enough Docker containers for you to be concerned about KVM automation, then you need to invest in automation anyway, for Docker.<p>But what is your alternative means of sandboxing the apps if you are concerned about users gaining access to the host? Outside of <i>other</i> VM solutions like Xen etc.? OpenVz? No matter which sandboxing method you choose, you&#x27;re either trading off security or picking complexity + additional latency and inefficiency.<p>> Process monitor? What are you talking about? At least with LXC, each container has PID 1 (master application process, init system, whatever) and can be stopped/started easily with lxc-stop -n nameofcontainer.<p>Yes, and if you want to stuff an sshd inside an lxc container or docker container alongside your application process, that means you will typically need use init, daemontools, mon or a similar tool to be the pid 1 in the container responsible for spawning the sshd and app, instead of just letting the application itself be the &quot;local&quot; pid 1. Which means that you don&#x27;t typically end up <i>just</i> adding sshd, but dragging in additional dependencies as well.<p>> As for sshd, my point was that it can make sense because it&#x27;s secure, remote-accessible, proven<p>That doesn&#x27;t change if it&#x27;s run on the host, and you force &quot;nsenter&quot;. But it also does not protect you against the potential for escaping the containers. If the &quot;secure&quot; part here matters for you, you should be considering a full VM (optionally with Docker inside, but not <i>just</i> Docker) until Docker has substantially more testing behind it.<p>> That aren&#x27;t remotely accessible, without breaking the abstraction and creating some shared access scenario on the host.<p>First of all, restricting remote access is a <i>good thing</i>. Part of the point is that with a properly developed container image coupled with the proper tools, you should not <i>need</i> to access individual containers remotely. \nOpening up for remote access is not just a security problem, but a massive configuration management hassle.<p>The number of problems that gets created, or not properly fixed, because people get sloppy when they have direct access to poke around production servers / vms / containers is one of the biggest ops headaches I&#x27;ve had the misfortune of dealing with over the last 20 years. Yes, you may occasionally need to poke around to trouble-shoot, and so having some means of gaining access is still necessary, but as the article points out: You still do.<p>(And again, if you have problems with granting access to the host, you should not trust Docker without containing it in a VM)<p>So in other words: They are just as remotely accessible as the same apps would be outside of the containers. And if your proposed alternative is to replace this:<p><pre><code>     - app1\n     - app2\n     - app3\n     - sshd + a single binary that&#x27;ll soon be in pretty much all distro&#x27;s.\n</code></pre>\nwith this:<p><pre><code>     - init1\n          - app1\n          - sshd2\n     - init2\n          - app2\n          - sshd2\n     - init3\n          - app3\n          - sshd3\n     - sshd\n</code></pre>\nWith either extra bind-mounts or replicating config files/keys for all the sshd&#x27;s - neither a &quot;free&quot; solution in terms of complexity.<p>... then we don&#x27;t have at all the same view of what complexity is.",1403845998
