VMM is (arguably) better than nothing, but there&#x27;s a lot about it that&#x27;s really broken [1], which can be very frustrating if you&#x27;re trying to build large-scale exercisers.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in the subject, I also recommend reading the book &quot;SystemVerilog for Verification&quot; [2]; it is &quot;the book&quot; on the subject, and although it teaches VMM, it&#x27;s an excellent reference on the concept of verification to begin with.  (It suffers some from the same problem that Kent Beck&#x27;s Test Driven Development book has -- it verifies excessively simple things -- but IMO, the techniques that it teaches scale much better than Beck&#x27;s techniques inasmuch as they&#x27;re actually possible to use in real world applications.)<p>[1] For instance, for some laughs, take a look at the API reference for the channel datastructure, vmm_channel: <a href=""http://www.vmmcentral.org/uvm_vmm_ik/files2/vmm_channel-sv.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vmmcentral.org/uvm_vmm_ik/files2/vmm_channel-sv.h...</a> -- there is just so much bizarrely wrong that I can&#x27;t even list it all.  &quot;Sneak&quot; is a good place to start, though...<p>[2] \n<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/SystemVerilog-Verification-Learning-Testbench-Language/dp/1461407141"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/SystemVerilog-Verification-Learning-Te...</a>",1397890596

7612782,comment,7612156,7612156,2,0,zaroth,,,"&quot;Preview Mockups on Devices in Realtime&quot; - Does this say exactly what you want it to say, because it&#x27;s the very first thing I read, and I need to understand it before I read any further. What this said to me, on first impression, is a way to see final renders of a URL on different browsers and running on different devices. Only later am I thinking this connects to Photoshop actually?<p>Scrolling down, I don&#x27;t understand the huge picture of a bird. Switch the white to transparent, the blue to white, and put it small in the top-left corner I think. But you know it looks too much like twitter, you probably will want to change it. One random suggestion to make it distinct; add a tablet with a wireframe, and the hummingbird is feeding off it.<p>&quot;Hummingbird lets you preview designs and webpages from your computer on devices in realtime.&quot; Did you consider adding the word &#x27;target&#x27; almost anywhere you say devices? Is it &quot;designs and webpages&quot; or &quot;webpage designs&quot;? Is it devices, or browsers? I guess &quot;devices&#x27; browsers&quot; actually.<p>Maybe a table with what devices you support. I think that would make it immediately clear what you were doing. You could also have a &#x27;Preview&#x27; which shows how you used hummingbird running against your own site.<p>&quot;Hummingbird works on Android and on any browser that supports websockets (Safari on iOS, IE 10 on Windows Phone, Chrome and Firefox on desktops...).&quot; OK, now reality is starting to sink in. I&#x27;m going to need to possess each one of these devices... and have it setup and configured... It&#x27;s not really HTML Preview Service.<p>It would be nice to mention you are releasing under MIT license on the main page. I looked for the source for Android and iOS builds, but it&#x27;s not up on Github yet, so I guess at this point it&#x27;s not quite fully released. But everything is brand new as of today, so no problem to wait and see when it comes.<p>I&#x27;d love a screen capture of the installation process, and example output. Even better, show me how this fits in your workflow and how it makes you work faster. If you can fit a compelling demo in under a minute, I would put it at the top/center.<p>I think it would be cool on the site to tell us if this is a hobby project, MVP, or what are YOUR goals with this? Just switch into first person and go for it :-)",1397889688
