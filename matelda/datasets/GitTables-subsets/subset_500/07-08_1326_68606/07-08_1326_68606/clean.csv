A language like Rust is completely worthless if it&#x27;s not fast; we&#x27;ve got a dozen languages that are already memory-safe and within 2x the speed of C. Given that Rust&#x27;s plethora of safety mechanisms mean that numeric overflow can&#x27;t cause memory unsafety, I completely understand why they would take the practical route rather than the theoretically-perfect route (even if, as predicted, they get crucified for it by armchair language designers).",1419839662

It just hides that fact from you better.<p>In an app that grabs a page from a database and returns it, the node.js app will receive a request from a user, make a request to the database, receive a request from another user, make a request to the database, then wait for either database request to return, then return it to the user, then when the other returns, return that to the user.<p>Your program doesn&#x27;t deal with one whole request at a time, it chops it up into lots of little &quot;wait for this event&quot; parts and node.js has an event loop that listens for events, which can happen in an arbitrary order. So you can be waiting for hundreds of events to happen for hundreds of requests, and as node.js doesn&#x27;t make you wait for the first one to process the second, nobody&#x27;s holding up anyone else.<p>Threading does <i>nearly exactly this</i> automatically... except that you need memory per thread in order to maintain the illusion that each thread has complete control over the CPU (its own stack, etc), and it can also split up CPU-bound workloads automatically. node.js needs much less memory per event it&#x27;s waiting for.",1419839400

When it hit -25 degree outside I was sure that my cold water showers will put me in bed but that never happened. The only inconvenience was (and is) that many hygiene products (shampoos, soaps, and such) work poorly with cold water and it takes more time to properly wash myself.

Simple example: A bond with a face value of $1,000, coupon of 5%, payable each year. Assume that new bonds are issued each year with the same face value and that the face value is also the minimum purchase amount. Your yearly coupon of $50 from the original bond is not enough to buy new bonds and so it remains uninvested. Things like mutual funds/bond funds/bond ETFs attempt to solve this problem by allowing you to reinvest small amounts, albeit at the expense of charging you a management fee.)",1419837062

In the following 2 years, I gained quite a bit of body hair (more than typical in the family), which I (now) attribute to the cold temperatures I had to endure during the first winters due to poor heating and light clothing. My point is: perhaps the body has more tricks up its sleeve than just to turn up the heating by burning more calories, not all of them as desirable as we&#x27;d hope. Then again, it might have been normal for my age and not related to climate, although I had plenty of facial hair very early (at 14) and generally didn&#x27;t develop/grow much after 16.<p>Needless to say, I wasn&#x27;t able to reverse the process with proper heating.

8808815,comment,8807309,8808787,0,0,conistonwater,,,"> there is an argument that as a civilization matures, interest rates trend toward zero.<p>I&#x27;m inherently suspicious of any argument that is supposed to apply to &quot;civilizations&quot;. Not that it doesn&#x27;t matter, but there are usually much more simple explanations to be found elsewhere. For example, whatever we know about money in the Roman empire, we know <i>far</i> more about money in Britain, US, France, Germany, etc., in the last several centuries.<p>> So it isn&#x27;t a foregone conclusion that interest rates will ever return to the &quot;normal&quot; levels of the 20th century, at least until a new global paradigm comes along.<p>The way I understand interest rates work, from conventional macroeconomics, is that some people have money to spend and invest, and some people want to borrow money and spend it on something that will make them more money. So when you look at the interest rates, you aren&#x27;t really looking at the riskiness of a modern government (US is definitely risk-free, UK also probably), you are mostly looking at the &quot;price&quot; of the people&#x27;s savings.<p>When lots of people want to save, interest rates --- the price others are going to pay to borrow --- will go down to balance the supply and demand of savings. So one way of looking at low interest rates is to see this as a situation where there is an excess of desired savings (i.e. the interest rate that would truly balance savings and investment is below the current rate, which is already almost zero in real terms). This explanation is incomplete (you need to introduce another constraint, and do more macroeconomics), but it&#x27;s more conventional, and I think also more robust than most theories of civilization.",1419836671

The entire core of your current argument is baseless fiction:<p>You just quoted the Swedish prosector explaining why Assange <i>can&#x27;t</i> be questioned in the UK. They expect to charge Assange, and hence need him to be in Sweden so they can put him on trial. The High Court saw this clearly (see the end of this post for more detail). It&#x27;s bizarre to infer from this statement that the EAW is unnecessary. It&#x27;s unnecessary if you&#x27;re already assuming that Assange is innocent and hence should not be put on trial.<p>>If you think the burden of disproving he-said-she-said allegations based on secret evidence is reasonable and defendants have anything but an &quot;extremely limited&quot; ability to challenge accusations on the basis of fact, you may as well just tank the presumption of innocence and start championing military tribunals for the general public.<p>Again, you&#x27;re confusing the extradition hearing with a rape trial. Assange can argue that he&#x27;s innocent of the charges when (if) he&#x27;s put on trial for rape in Sweden. The English courts are not making any findings regarding the facts of the case; they are just enforcing the EAW.<p>>THERE IS NOTHING LEGALLY STOPPING HER from accepting Assange&#x27;s offers to cooperate in whatever way would not expose him to extradition to the United States.<p>His cooperation is besides the point at this stage in the investigation. As the court judgments explain, the presumption at this stage in the investigation is that he will be charged and eventually brought to trial. Hence, his presence in Sweden is necessary. From the High Court judgment: &quot;In our view, the terms of the EAW read as a whole made clear that not only was the EAW issued for the purpose of Mr Assange being prosecuted for the offence, but that he was required for the purposes of being tried after being identified as the perpetrator of specific criminal offences. He was therefore accused of the offences specified in the EAW. Nothing in the EAW suggested he was wanted for questioning as a suspect.&quot;<p>Now, could the Swedish prosecutor have choosen to do nothing more than some further questioning on Assange in England? Well, sure, they can handle the case how they like. But they chose not to. I&#x27;m not sure how many times I have to point this out before it sinks in, but Assange can&#x27;t expect to run the investigation himself on his own terms! Once the Swedes have decided to charge him, the English courts can&#x27;t just piss all over the Swedish legal process. The clue is in the name: European Arrest Warrant. Once Sweden issues it through the proper legal process, the presumption is that England will enforce it. There is no &quot;presumption of innocence&quot; when considering whether or not to enforce a legally obtained arrest warrant, since the facts of the case are not being decided at all.<p>>principle that the legal system should be invoked in ways proportional to the accusation and bearing the public interest in mind.<p>The accusation is rape, so there is no disproportionality, and it&#x27;s in the public interest for rapists to be prosecuted.<p>>arguing around the reasonability of the extradition instead of providing an example of a commensurate offense.<p>I&#x27;ve explained already that I don&#x27;t see why this is relevant. If he was being extradited for a parking ticket, I&#x27;d see your point, but the charge strikes me as serious enough to merit extradition, both legally and morally.",1419836476
