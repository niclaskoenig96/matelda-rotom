4026792,comment,4026017,4026017,4,0,jacobolus,,,"Its annoying that their graphic shows percent share of various electricity sources, rather than total quantity, and then makes statements like The importance of coal in Americas energy mix has indeed tumbled since 1997. The unstated implication of the words + graphic is that were using less coal than we used to be. But if you look at their data source, first it doesnt include 1997 at all, but more importantly, in 2008 we generated more electricity from coal than in 1998, and the average electricity generation from coal in the last 5 years is higher than the amount generated in either of the first couple years. But mostly, what does it mean for the importance in the energy mix to tumble? If we stopped using coal power, the price of energy would spike up dramatically; coal is pretty much essential to our current energy mix.<p>The story I see in the data is that our energy use grows on average about 1% per year, with a bit of a dip in 2009, presumably due to the recession. The amount of electricity from natural gas has almost doubled and continues to rise, the amount from hydroelectric dams has been slowly creeping downward, and the amount from other renewable sources has been increasing steadily but is still a small fraction of our total energy mix.",1338017918
