I run a website that helps people find a home to buy that is at most, if it works great for them, maybe 5% or 10% better or cheaper (your pick) than what they could have gotten otherwise.  And even then, only in the LA area.  Is that really about the best thing I (along with my co-founder) could've been working on the last two years?<p>I'm going to say yes, and here's why.  Three reasons.  One, opportunity.  I work with semi-realistic options -- it's not productive of me, a 90's college dropout, to pursue medical research at this point.  But I have ten years of experience programming and I do at some point need to put food on my family, as the saying goes.<p>Two, passion, or you could say just motivation.  This is a problem that I have faced, my parents faced, their parents faced.  I know the technology can make it better and am fascinated with the possibilities.  I believe passion is immensely important to making the most of one's talent.<p>Three, getting the ball rolling.  As an innovator in a little bitty part of the gigantic web, one who can only implement a tiny fraction of the things I want to, I know I have a limited impact.  But twenty years from now, for all I know, people around the world could be using stuff like what I'm pushing into the market.  I have no idea what impact that will have.<p>So hey, if I make money, I would appreciate that, but I really think I'm doing what I want to do with what I've got regardless of that.  But if you have the interest, let me hear more about your pitch for what I or someone like myself could be doing instead, because this is, after all, a subject of vital interest.",1190278513

57322,comment,57298,57315,0,0,Shooter,,,"Yeah, I read your site.  I'll email you, but I'm posting this here to get input on this issue from others.  Cheap marketing research.  I really don't mean to bust chops.<p>I'm just not sure I agree with the 'feel good' angle of your diagnostic kit.   There seems to be three options you can take with a genetic testing kit:<p> \n1.""You are naturally resistant to X.  Yay for you.""<p>2.""You are going to get or already have X disease. Sucks to be you.  Please take your diseased carcass elsewhere to cry.""<p>3. ""You have an increased risk for X.  Here are some things you can do about it.""<p>I can see wanting to avoid option two, but I like option three better than option one.  I guess I'm a pessimist.  I'd much rather learn that I have an increased risk than a reduced risk (Well, I don't really want ANY bad news...but you know what I mean.)  Knowing my wife was genetically predisposed to skin cancer, for example, would have allowed us to be more proactive in monitoring her skin and making appropriate decisions regarding food, stress, sunlight, etc.  Instead, we were just lucky.  Now we know, and we were also able to have the rest of her family get checked out.  There is a known gene mutation for skin cancer and it would have been nice to know about it.",1190278456
57320,comment,56884,57103,0,0,davidw,,,"The problem is that governments should just get out of the way and let the private sector provide things like air transport.  There is no excuse for a bunch of taxpayers subsidizing other, most likely wealthier taxpayers' airplane rides with inefficient, bloated companies like Alitalia.",1190278178
57319,comment,56957,57129,0,0,auferstehung,,,"But a feedback loop is exactly what is desired.  The hard part is to amplify the signal while suppressing the noise.  Up/Down voting also creates a feedback loop that I would argue provides a very noisy signal of quality at best and an irrelevant signal at worst.  The thesis under consideration is whether comments can provide a better signal corresponding to the item commented on.  If this is true, it is desirable that items commented on climb higher and generate more comments,<p>If you consider comments to be analogous to links, the quality of a news item (or comment) can be extracted as easily as pagerank determines the quality of a webpage.  Controversy can not be distinguished from quality because they are orthoganol measures.  Many controversial issues (to VC or not to VC) are of high interest to readers of this site and would be considered high quality while off topic political controversies would probably not be considered high quality for this site.  In general, most interesting things are controversial. <p>The existence of noisy comment threads (jokes and snark) is a good point.  I would think that some form of Bayesian spam filtering could penalize these comments.  Off topic comments could be penalized similiarly if a Bayesian filter was trained using the text of the news item.<p>I disagree that disagreeing or disliking is disagreable.  I would call it conversation.<p>I don't think a bigger algorithm is the answer.  One with a good impedance match would suffice. ",1190278170
57318,comment,57298,57298,0,0,davidw,,,"I don't know... there are tons of people in medical research that perhaps ""do their bit"", but don't do anything really important.<p>I think that as long as you are doing what you do well honestly and with integrity, and it's basically something that creates value... do that, and don't worry if there's something else that could be improving the world more - perhaps you wouldn't do as good a job as you do with what you truly love.  Perhaps your cool startup will make some doctor's life easier, and give her more time to work on her research.  <p>That said... I think there are some opportunity costs for hackers chasing the startup dream that need to be taken into account.<p><a href=""http://journal.dedasys.com/articles/2007/06/05/paul-graham-and-the-opportunity-costs-of-startups"" rel=""nofollow"">http://journal.dedasys.com/articles/2007/06/05/paul-graham-a...</a>",1190277976

57315,comment,57298,57308,0,0,rms,,,"For people that are HIV+, the CCR5 delta32 mutation indicates a slower progression to AIDS. It's not a reliable enough measure to adjust dosages of anti-retroviral drugs though eventually we expect CCR5 delta32 to be part of a suite of tests to determine optimal HIV drug dosage.<p>For HIV- individuals, the test can provide relative peace of mind. We still strongly advocate safe sex to everyone but certain populations of people are very interested in eliminating a lingering fear of HIV that persists even when safe sexual practices are followed.<p>One of the reasons we chose this mutation to test for is because CCR5 delta32 is a mutation that you want to have -- it's a positive mutation. Most genetic tests tell you things like you are destined to get Huntington's Disease and most people just aren't interested in learning bad things about their genetic makeup.<p>I'm confident in the economics of our business, send me an email and we can talk numbers. :)",1190277165

57308,comment,57298,57301,0,0,Shooter,,,"I'm interested.  I've already tried to invest in lower-cost diagnostic kits for other diseases, but the company never achieved their price goals.<p>I am, I might add, probably the last person on earth that should be investing in life sciences since all my experience is in business/financial services, marketing and software.  I have a decent amount of experience with patents, though.<p>Quick question:  What is the real benefit of the saliva test you mention on your site?  I mean, your HIVgene diagnostic kit seems to approach the issue from the wrong angle, IMHO.  If anything, it seems like telling someone they have heightened natural resistance to a disease is almost irresponsible - it's like handing a ""Get Out of Jail Free - MAYBE"" card to them.  Am I missing something?",1190276290
57307,comment,57298,57303,0,0,rms,,,"The most important thing in the near future of life extension is Sirtris Pharmaceuticals's super-resveratrol, SRT501. Resveratrol is one of the beneficial substances in red wine. SRT501 lets you have the equivalent of 10,000 bottles worth of red wine with none of the poisonous effects of alcohol. SRT501 is much more economical than natural sources of resveratrol, which are currently too expensive to be useful for life extension, unless you want to spend around $100 a day. If I had money right now and they weren't denominated in the US Dollar, I would buy their stock.<p>The death of mitochondria hastens death from ""old-age"". SRT501 and resveratrol increase the number and function of your mitochondria. SRT501 is currently in clinical trials for diabetes and I fully expect it to increase average life spans by at least 10%, though this is not what it is getting FDA approval for. The day it hits the market I'm going to get an off-label prescription for it, as long as I can afford it.",1190276280

57304,comment,57298,57298,0,0,rkabir,,,"It's tough to say it without drawing out cynicism. Warren Buffet used to talk about why he didn't donate money earlier purely in terms of a return on capital. He felt (correctly, it would seem) that he was better at making his capital grow than many other people, and as such, would leave charity to others in the meantime, and give his money later (which he has).<p>The way I think about it is that I'm confident I'm better than most people (not news.YC'ers for sure, but most people) at larger perspectives, or at least feeling confident that I can tackle large problems. It would seem there are (relatively) few people who feel like they're in that position, and so I find a need to fill that.<p>What people forget over time (and this I think is what draws out the eye-rolling in general from many people with respect to the above) - is that if they're successful, they get caught up in the success and forget about the world changing they intended to do. And if I turn out not to be successful (after repeated attempts) - every failure should bring me closer and closer to tackling world-changing problems head-on.<p>In the meantime, I try to think big, I try to execute big, but I try to pay attention to the smaller details where I can have a positive impact with low opportunity cost.<p>Mainly, I think there's a high risk that people lose their idealism and empathy for others in the world over time - and that's tough to stave off.",1190275928

57302,comment,56618,56980,0,0,davidmathers,,,"GEB slowly builds up an analogy that likens inanimate molecules to meaningless symbols, and further likens selves (or ""I""'s or ""souls"" if you prefer -- whatever it is that distinguishes animate from inanimate matter) to certain special swirly, twisty, vortex-like, and meaningful patterns that arise only in particular types of systems of meaningless symbols. It is these strange, twisty patterns that the book spends so much time on, because they are little known, little appreciated, counterintuitive, and quite filled with mystery. And for reasons that should not be too difficult to fathom, I call such strange, loopy patterns ""strange loops"" throughout the book, although in later chapters, I also use the phrase ""tangled hierarchies"" to describe basically the same idea.<p>-- Douglas R.
