Affiliate links there, for those inclined.<p>===<p>In 2010, every single book I read, I read on my Kindle. Buying a Kindle has been the best thing I have ever done for my reading addiction. I recently upgraded to a Kindle 3, and I wholeheartedly recommended you get one as well, even if you currently have a Kindle 2.<p>Here are the top books I enjoyed in 2010, and you will enjoy also.<p>- The His Dark Materials Trilogy. Start with The Golden Compass.<p>- The City & The City by China Miéville. Quite the post-modern detective story. (Read also his novel Perdido Street Station)<p>- Surface Detail, the new novel by Iain M. Banks, who has quickly catapulted to the very top of my “Favorite Sci-Fi Authors” list. Surface Detail may not be the best novel for a Banks-unfamiliar reader, however — you may wish to start with something like Consider Phlebas or Look To Windward.<p>- I re-read Robert M. Pirsig’s Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. Read this book carefully and it will change your life. (N.B. It’s not really about Zen, although it kinda is.)<p>- The true story Zeitoun, by Dave Eggers, about Abdulrahman Zeitoun, a Syrian-born painting contractor in New Orleans. What Zeitoun does for the people of New Orleans in the aftermath of Katrina is heartwarming and truly American, and what the US Government does to him and his family is terrifying and utterly infuriating.<p>- The Wind-up Girl by Paolo Bacigalupi is a fun Thai cyber/gene-punk yarn. Bacigalupi is a new author, and I look forward to reading more of his stuff.<p>- Dan Simmons’ Song Of Kali has an invasive and palpable stench of suspense. This horror novel set in Calcutta is an excruciating, brutal, and brilliant read.<p>- Kafka On the Shore by Haruki Murakami. I’ve always been a fan of Murakami’s works, but this novel from 2002 is, in my opinion, one of his greatest. It’s beautiful, haunting, and superbly thought-provoking.",1294648063

The web as viewed on those phones is unlike those seen on computers or on modern smartphones. For example, NTT DoCoMo, one of the major Japanese cell service providers, launched its i-mode web service in 1999. Competing providers KDDI & J-Phone soon launched EZweb & J-Sky, respectively. By 2006, these services had already amassed 80 million subscribers.[0]<p>I highly doubt Facebook supports any of these services, which can make it very difficult to break into the Japanese market even if they get all the cultural kinks ironed out and pay some celebrities to endorse them.<p>0: <a href=""https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/I-mode"" rel=""nofollow"">https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/I-mode</a>",1294646992

Something like cheap wi-fi base stations [...]</i><p>Here in Germany, we have an initiative that is devoted to exactly that problem. It is called ""Freifunk"" and has been deployed successfully to other countries.<p><a href=""http://wiki.freifunk.net/Kategorie:English"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.freifunk.net/Kategorie:English</a><p>The Freifunk hackers did some amazing work to provide the needed firmware for many of the cheap standard wi-fi routers, as well as other hardware.<p>They are also doing good scientific work regarding mesh networks. Since they are working with real-world networks, their work usually surpasses the quality of university research. That's why nowadays many German universities are working together with Freifunk. For instance, they use Freifunk routers for their field tests.<p>If you want to build something like that in your town, you should definitely have a look at what those guys are doing, and I'm sure they'll be happy to assist you.",1294646936

Other methods include decision trees and logistic regression which seems to be popular at Google from what I can indirectly infer from their papers. More complex methods include bayesian and non bayesian graphical models, kernel methods (SVM, RVM) and not too hard but powerful methods are boosted trees, random forests and ensemble methods in general.<p>Layers of unsupervised learners (clustering) feeding into a supervised learner form a very powerful technique known as deep learning. This technique hasn't found a niche though and can be outperformed by shallower methods for much of where they are used [1]. And due to all this big data mumbo jumbo on-line learning methods are getting to be more important.<p>[1] <a href=""http://ai.stanford.edu/~ang/papers/nipsdlufl10-AnalysisSingleLayerUnsupervisedFeatureLearning.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ai.stanford.edu/~ang/papers/nipsdlufl10-AnalysisSingl...</a>",1294646886
