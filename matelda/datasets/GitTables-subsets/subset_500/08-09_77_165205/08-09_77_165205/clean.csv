648754,comment,648729,648729,0,0,__david__,,,"So on the one hand it's completely understandable for AT&T to charge what it's charging. On the other hand, being in the position where I don't qualify sucks. I can't (and don't) blame them, but I don't have to like it. Perhaps I can offset the cost by unlocking my current phone and selling it on ebay.<p>IMO, the more imporant reason to be annoyed at AT&T is the whole MMS and tethering situation. My old Sony Ericsson phone could do MMS 2 years ago, so why does AT&T suddenly need 2 months for a ""network upgrade"" for it to work? I have a feeling someone is leaving an out important detail...<p>And tethering--Why do I have to potentially pay more for tethering capability when I already have and ""unlimited data"" plan? If the answer is ""because computers consume more bandwidth than phones"" then I have to say it's not really ""unlimited"" now, is it? And again, why is not available up front? What on earth do you have to do on the back end to enable tethering? Isn't it strictly a client issue?",1244537704

It looks discrete and easy to quantify from a distance, but the closer you look, the more you find that deep down, its made of nearly nothing at all. We (society) just picked something out of our asses, nearly at random, and went with it. It only got the force of morality attached to it later in the game when people had lived with it for a while.

Personally I like to think at the possible outcomes of policies. and decide which outcome I would like best.<p>Free books could lead to more reading, but less books being written. On the other hand, they could even lead to more reading and MORE books being written (because authors would have more readers, which might matter more than the paltry income they get from book sales). Who knows, they could even lead to LESS reading, because the perceived value of books could go down. It is not so clear cut to decide...<p>One thing I am 100% sure about: libraries and the ""free"" books they provide are very important for a society. At least for me, being technical minded and entrepreneurial minded, they can make the difference for me between being able to create a viable business or not. Also I am quite certain that for technical books the motivation to write them is not the money - it is very hard to make any money with technical books, so I think they would mostly be written to boost reputation.<p>For fiction books I don't know. Clearly a lot of them were written regardless of the income they might generate, but probably hoping for riches and fame motivates at least some authors.",1244535459
