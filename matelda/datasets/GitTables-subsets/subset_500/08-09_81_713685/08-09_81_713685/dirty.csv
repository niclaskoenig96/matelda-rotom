I found that on a mac the same shortcuts I use in the terminal (readline bindings), I can use most everywhere (ctrl-a for line start/ ctrl-w to kill last word etc...). For the most part Vimium takes care of the browser.<p>I have often found the windows shortcuts to be hidden an obscure.  Alt+F4 is the defacto kill app on windows but trying to press it is inconvenient especially while Alt+tabbing through windows.<p>I agree command and control can be confusing but they give you more range in keyboard shortcuts as a result.   The windows 8 search (although an improvement over 7) is also medicore compared to OSX spotlight making it much easier to CMD+Tab and navigate to different apps.<p>The least keyboard friendly part is certainly the windows cmd prompt where pasting is ALT+SPACE+E+P ... as opposed to CMD+V on OSX... not mention the lack of navigational shortcuts in the cmd prompt (kill back a word, kill rest of line etc...)<p>The most frustrating part for me is windows shortcuts not being consistent throughout apps.  In most of the windows CTRL+BACKSPACE will kill the last word but not in notepad? or most winform applications...  Ctrl-F is find in most apps but &quot;forward email&quot; in outlook?<p>I guess its really a matter of personal preference, but I think as far as keyboard shortcuts go, both OS&#x27;s have plenty.",1388133114
6969923,comment,6969271,6969826,3,0,Crito,,,"Few points here:<p>> Text being unreadable due to no spaces at all.&quot;<p>Text without spaces is readable.  Text with spaces is <i>more</i> readable.  Readability is a continuum.  Literature is <i>certainly</i> readable without bold, italics, underlining, and indentation.<p>Colored text, for people with normal vision, remains clear.  Clarity is not lost, another channel for transmitting information to the user is added.<p>We don&#x27;t use <i>color</i> highlighting in books, but perhaps we should.  I haven&#x27;t tried it, so I cannot say it would not be better.  I have heard it suggested that coloring lines of dialog would make literature easier to read.  I think it is very plausible that Shakespeare in particular could be made more accessible with the use of color.  With the rise of ebooks, this sort of experimentation is now feasible and I think that it is likely that we <i>will</i> see people experimenting with this sort of thing as the new capabilities that ebook devices provide give us an opportunity to revisit some traditions that were originally set in place by material constraint.<p>And lastly, code is not read as literature typically is.  Most literature is written with linearity in mind.  Most code is written under the assumption that the reader will jump up and down it repetitively, frequently jumping to random locations in the file.  Coloring code therefore becomes useful in much the same way that coloring road atlases are useful.  You don&#x27;t need to trace a road back to the nearest label to find out that it is an interstate; you can tell right away because it is blue.  That big area inside of that squiggly line?  It&#x27;s a state park, you can tell because it is slightly green, so you don&#x27;t need to look around on either side for the dotted line surrounding it.  That green area in the middle?

But as we know well, the encryption is the absolute last thing which is going to fail or be broken independent of some other action.<p>NSA can fill their hard drives with all the cipher text they want. If that ciphertext ever somehow becomes valuable on its own -- for example, without getting a warrant for the key - then the crypto-apocalypse has arrived and the whole discussion about which data center the server runs in is completely pointless.<p>We haven&#x27;t seen any Snowden leaks indicating NSA is walking into US data centers without a warrant and busting servers. On the other hand, their entire modus operandi is to do <i>exactly that</i> overseas. Wait, or is that the CIA... Generally speaking, if you have something they really want and it&#x27;s on a US server, you get agents at the door with warrants. If you have something they really want and it&#x27;s on a non-US server, they just hack or steal the damn server.<p>See my earlier reply about the Google packet sniffing, done only for data which <i>left</i> the US as far as we know. There would be a much stronger case that such packet interception was illegal and unconstitutional under current US law if it was happening to traffic running within US only WANs.<p>By the way, there&#x27;s nothing you can do if the service provider decides to just accept the warrant and provide the data, regardless of where the server is colocated, which is why I think self-hosted SaaS is so important. You might not be able to stop them getting the data, but if it&#x27;s on your server, you probably will know they have taken it, or otherwise you&#x27;ll have a <i>great</i> case to argue in front of the Supreme Court (as in, an EFF pro bono spectacle, not necessarily that you will prevail).<p>The people that put these surveillance systems in place don&#x27;t give two fucks about the economic impact, and the people that do consider the economic impact aren&#x27;t invited to the meetings.<p>tl;dr People should be really screaming mad angry about what the US government is doing, but foot shooting is perhaps exactly the response they are looking for.",1388132272
