People seem to appreciate some of my writing about living in Italy, and even more importantly, I've made some good friends after people have contacted me to say hi and get information.  I don't mix that up with the technical/business blog, though, which is on another domain entirely.",1205834316
139717,comment,139060,139224,0,0,mironathetin,,,"Let me clarify what I mean.<p>If we apply for a job, this means we are in competition. Competition may have two outcomes: either we win the competition or we lose. If we lose, we have to be fair and respect that someone else has done better (whatever this means). As the loser (or second winner ;o) you may think about how to improve, but what does killing mean in this context? If someone has the notion to kill he is not smart enough to win a competition and he knows it. Who wants to identify with this?<p>In his post Seth Godin misses some points imho. In most jobs, and especially in most developer jobs, work means being added to a team. Team - this has to do with fairness again. Now, who wants a self proclaimed superstar in his team? What you need is a smart contributor who does not have to be the best and most shining everytime.<p>If you talked yourself into a situation where you think you are so great that you don't even need a resume, you are definitely out of the team game.<p>If, on the other hand, you have a cool working business, website or any reference and companies approach you, you may not want to work for companies any more.",1205834223

139714,comment,138966,139196,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"3) Use of human devices that are biped specific<p>Ladders, automobiles and heavy machinery, household equipment, etc. all rule out quadrupeds.<p>While it would be possible to custom-build all of this stuff to be usable by a quadruped, it means you then have to have two of everything if you plan to cohabitate with a robot assistant.  From the perspective of assistance robots, it's not going to be possible to accomplish everything without bipedal bots.<p>I think wheeled bots (like Trevor's Monty) will also be a great option--probably a tenth the cost of a walking mechanism, an order of magnitude more speed and endurance, etc.  But they'll still be unsuitable for many assistance robot tasks.  Stairs, for example.  And unlike the Daleks, leveling the building will not suffice as a solution to the problem of climbing stairs.",1205833918

139707,comment,139701,139701,0,0,mixmax,,,"I actually like it a lot.<p>I had a little to do with movies (a friend of mine was nominated for an Oscar two years ago and we had some discussions about starting a company together in the film biz) and my (limited) experience would suggest that you would run into the following problems:<p>- They are a dead conservative bunch. It is hard to convince them to try something new.<p>- There's a lot of politics and who-knows-who that you would have to overcome<p>- Instead of having just a few people read through a script maybe it should be free for all to read through and rate. That way you will have a good selling point to Hollywood - ""hey - 500.000 people read this script and rated it, they will all go see the movie when it comes out. And bring their friends and family!""<p>- Marketing will be the hard part. You actually have to get people to use the damn thing...<p>I think that you income model should probably be to take a cut of the selling price for a script. They aint cheap you know...<p>Just some thoughts...",1205832846
139706,comment,139641,139691,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"""while it turns out that the team which decided on a fine-grained sleeps-and-spins locking structure were correct, I can't fault Matt for not having as much faith""<p>I agree, and I'd find it very hard to have anything but the utmost respect for him.  His C compiler for the Amiga, DICE, was where I began to learn about real software development and the UNIX tool chain, so he holds a place nearly comparable to K&R in my history as a hacker.<p>It's just unfortunate that some personality conflicts have led to a great developer bitterly spinning his wheels for several years on something that is clearly going the wrong way.  (Then again, I can't say that of OpenBSD, as it's spawned a lot of great stuff, though it may have looked like the same kind of situation a few years into the project.  NetBSD, I'm a little iffy on....)<p>""The FreeBSD ports system works very well""<p>Ah, you have to say that, or you'll wake up with a horse head in your bed.  It's the official party line.  ;-)<p>Actually, to be more clear about my intent, the ports system does work very well for the problem that it solves.<p>The problem is that it's solving the wrong problem, and no one will admit it because it looks so pretty solving the problem that it does solve very well.  Because ports exists, and works really well for its problem domain, it has prevented any real solutions from being put into place for package management and has also caused a lot of weird and incompatible tools to spring up to deal with various meta-problems like managing software on many machines (for example).  Meanwhile, over in Linux-land, not just one, but two, really good package management systems (yum+rpm and apt-get+dpkg) have sprung up and made it possible for many people to produce nicely bundled software (and provide for the dependencies in an automated fashion) for Linux...while distributing software for FreeBSD is a choice of many poor options, mostly ending up with a tarball and a shell script.<p>Anyway, I think freebsd-update is a great improvement, and the right direction.  (I'm really not just blowing smoke...it makes me feel a lot better about our customers using FreeBSD.  Now, if only you could do something about the silly secondary groups limit of 16, and fix the default username length, I'd have nothing left to complain about...well, except for the other package management issues.)",1205832735
