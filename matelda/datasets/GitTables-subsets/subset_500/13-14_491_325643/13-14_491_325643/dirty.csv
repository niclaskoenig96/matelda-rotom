We have a number of organizations who host regular events (<a href=""http://www.technologyiowa.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.technologyiowa.org/</a>, <a href=""http://smcdsm.ning.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://smcdsm.ning.com/</a>, etc...) along with a very good supply of technology user groups covering all of the major techs (.Net, Ruby, Java, etc).<p>As for finding people to bounce ideas off of, attending those events, meeting new people, and just talking about what you're doing has worked well for me.<p>We also have two (that I'm aware of) co-working locations. These are great because it groups together like minded people who are always willing to listen to ideas you want to bounce.<p>Starting a blog to bounce ideas off of your users doesn't sound like a very good way to go to me. It would take a really long time, and would be a lot more work. I'm not saying it can't, and shouldn't be done. I'm just saying getting out and meeting people will be better.<p>We're also in close proximity to larger cities too, so we often get talent coming in to work for start-ups here.<p>And we have a news site to keep tabs on all of this, <a href=""http://www.siliconprairienews.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.siliconprairienews.com/</a>. This basically allows a one stop shop for seeing what's going on, and where you might be able to meet new like-minded people.<p>I guess this turned into more of a pro-Iowa post, but I think it gives you some answers  :)",1278683979

A battery of scientific studies done on Cox over the years has revealed some startling facts about her physiology. First, the muscle and fat in her body are so perfectly balanced that she has neutral buoyancy, meaning that she neither sinks in water nor floats. As one researcher told her, ""You're at one with the water"" - a critical energy-saving advantage during long-distance swims.<p>More remarkable, however, was the discovery that Cox's body is superbly adapted to cold temperatures. On entering cold water, a person's surface blood vessels constrict, forcing warm blood to the vital organs at the body's core. Normally, however, this is a stopgap that works for only a short time. By contrast, Cox's vital organs are insulated by an evenly distributed layer of insulating fat. Warm blood shunted to her core remains warm dramatically longer. So effective is this ""internal wet suit,"" that Cox's temperature actually rises during a hard swim in cold water.""<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynne_Cox"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynne_Cox</a>",1278683186

The posted article claims 25% to 45%, but who knows how ideal the conditions have to be to reach that level.<p>You are also absolutely correct that treating at the tailpipe is even better (for exactly the reasons my analogy makes clear).<p>That said, I will defend my analogy.  My point was that dealing with NOx at the road surface will likely be more effective than dealing with it more generally in the atmosphere-- in part because the effective volumes aren't as huge as you might think (see the comment I was responding to), and in part because you're dealing with the NOx at higher concentrations.<p>I'm sure you're right that NOx disperses rapidly, but I'd bet that concentrations still are demonstrably higher at the roadway surface than, say, a block away.  For example, this study found a factor of 5 difference between NOx at the side of a busy intersection, versus that some distance away:\n<a href=""http://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/10/2745/2010/acp-10-2745-2010.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/10/2745/2010/acp-10-2745-2010...</a><p>Second, I bet the boundary layer isn't all that thick at the road surface.  After all, by definition you have cars passing along, stirring up a lot of turbulence.  (Besides, even in quiescent conditions, you still get diffusive transport through the boundary layer, due to concentration differences-- and destroying NOx at the surface will set that up for you.)",1278682708

I mean you may think it's a long way down the road to the chemist, but that's just peanuts to space"" -Douglas Adams<p>I'm not sure if I buy this ""earth orbit will be dangerously crowded with debris"" business there is a LOT of room up there, the volume of space we are discussing is bigger then the volume of earth, and even if there is a high density of debris most of it is small bits of metal at orbital velocities, which would likely cause similar danger to micrometeorites: which are an engineering problem we need to solve anyway (the whole pray it does not hit anything that goes boom and throw a patch over it fast plan is not acceptable)",1278680711

Those mugs are doing it becuase they think they are going to be taking money out - but, like any pyramid scheme, only the people at the top of the pile will make any money.  How long do you think those mugs will keep paying in without getting anything out?<p>I'm willing to go on record with the following predictions:<p>1. No big site will get enough money to be worth the pixels the button takes up.\n2. No small site will get back as much as they put in.\n3. The number of people who pay in without expecting to get anything out will be essentially zero.\n4. Flattr will shut down entirely within 2 years from today.",1278680404
