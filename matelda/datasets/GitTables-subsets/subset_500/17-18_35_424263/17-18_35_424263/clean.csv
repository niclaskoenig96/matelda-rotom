Accounting principles require the use of judgements by people  (accountants, regulators, bankers, controllers) whose judgements have proven to be unreliable at best. The filters that these parties represent should should be removed and we should be allowed sufficient information to make our own judgements.<p>By disclosing the actual details of a complex transaction on a timely basis, truly independent outsiders would be able to judge and report on the aggregate book, built from a line-by-line analysis. I like call this Real Transparency.<p>This analysis has become technically feasible in recent years, thanks to faster CPUs, and the cost of distributing this information has dropped dramatically, thanks to cheaper storage and faster networks. Mandating this type of disclosure would be one of the really useful things the government could do. The current proposed reforms simply give more power to the regulators who permitted Enron, Madoff and Lehman.<p>Complexity is not the real enemy of truth. It is people gaming a system with built-in opacity. Increase the transparency and there won't be any games left to play.",1270403452

A HTC Hero starts at around $345.<p>Wanna bet what the difference between the 3GS and nexus looks like in a year from now?<p>If you start looking into older models (G1 vs older generation iPhone) the difference becomes more dramatic, that's where I pulled the $99 figure from. You can already grab a G1 for around $100 on eBay. It won't be long before the new (and more worthwhile) low-end models enter that price-range.<p>That's when the trouble for apple starts. A G1 is obviously no competition for an iPhone of any generation, no matter the price-point. A droid or nexus in the sub-$200 range? Now that's a different story.<p>And yes, you can buy all phones with a 2 year contract to stretch out the cost.

1240468,comment,1240179,1240234,0,0,pavlov,,,"What rapid spread? There were far more platforms before, with far more significant differences.<p>In the late '80s, a popular game was commonly ported to half a dozen platforms: Amiga, Atari ST, Apple II, Commodore 64, PC+EGA, PC+VGA -- sometimes even Sinclair and MSX. Even the hardware was usually completely different between systems, e.g. the powerful custom graphics and audio chips on the Amiga.<p>In the '90s, a cross-platform desktop application like Netscape would have to run on a range of very different systems: Windows 3.1 (16-bit), Windows 95 (32-bit with new UI), Windows NT (32-bit with old UI), Mac OS 7 (32-bit with no memory protection), Solaris, Linux, AIX, HP/UX...<p>In comparison, Windows 7, Mac OS X and modern Linux are basically the same. It's easy to write cross-platform C applications using mostly UNIX APIs and deploy them on Windows using MinGW and a couple of lightweight libraries like pthread-win32. For cross-platform GUI applications, the Qt framework is available pretty much everywhere, even phones.<p>This is pretty amazing. Essentially everything has become ""UNIX-like"" nowadays -- even the smartphone stalwart Symbian has given up trying to pretend it's something else.",1270401962

How is this innovative? Newspapers and magazines have had their content online for years now hoping that ad revenue would make it sustainable, it hasn't. Why is ad placement in an iPad app that much different? Because they can charge more for premium iPad ads? I'd argue that thinking suddenly the ad rates are going to jump dramatically (to the point of sustainability) just because the app is on an iPad is more delusional than thinking you can charge for content.<p>Then his second example is even more absurd. He cites NPR's iPad app/iPad friendly website. But there's no mention of monetization of the web content whatsoever. So in this example he's saying ""good job NPR, you're not making a dime on your iPad content, that's the way to go"".
