89618,comment,89183,89492,0,0,Tichy,,,"I tend to think that if users really think they need something, they'll find a way to get it. For example, most people managed to get themselves a DVD Player. They saw that their neighbours were doing some cool thing in their homes, and m,anaged to inform themselves and buy the bloody players. <p>If people were so keen on IE alternatives, they would pester their bosses to be allowed to switch. Apparently, FF is not different enough for people to care. <p>Going the legal way might just open a huge can of worms. For example, how likely will companies be in the future to agree on standards, if next thing they know they'll end up in court for it? As a company, I'd rather stick to my proprietary stuff instead (Flash...). <p>Also, maybe it simply isn't so easy to be 100% compliant to a specification. Is the specification even unambiguous enough, and clear enough for every developer getting the same picture? Should we really use the courts to establish the meanings of paragraphs in specifications like that? And what about Opera, they suck pretty bad, too - if Microsoft gets some flack, they should be next. <p>As a web developer, I'd rather wish the EU would shoot down both IE and Opera, and simply force everyone to use Firefox. While they are at it, they should also disallow new versions of Firefox to come out, because they might force me to adapt my code. But that is not the world we REALLY want to live in, or is it?",1197658440

89615,story,,,10,19,dmpayton,"Ask YC: Interview at Startup -- What to expect?",,"Hello,<p>I'm a 20 year-old web developer with a wife and a baby on the way. I have an interview at a startup on Monday, Dec 17, and have a few questions for the startup community.<p>First, the position is for a PHP developer. While I started out in PHP and worked in it for several years, I haven't touched it since March when I switched to Python, and I've grown a bit rusty. Can you recommend any specific area that I should brush up on?<p>Secondly, what sort of questions should I expect to be thrown at me? I'm not really expecting too much about programming in general, as they're going to have me write some code, but what other kinds of questions might I get asked?<p>Finally, what questions should I throw back at them? I've read that interviews are just as much for the potential employee as the company, and there's the obvious asking about salary, benefits, programming environment, desktop setup... But is there anything I should make sure to ask?<p>A bit about the company: ""Galaxy IT, Inc. is working on a web application that will take your current addiction of wasting time online, and your real-world need to get things done, and make it possible for you to do both at once.""<p>Their website is <a href=""http://www.galaxyit.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.galaxyit.com</a><p>I apologize for the short time-frame between this post and my interview date. They asked me to interview on Tuesday, and since then I've frantically been trying to get things prepared. I only just now thought about asking news.YC. If you can't tell, I'm quite nervous about the interview. What they're working on sounds really neat, and the pay is much more than I'm making now (and with the baby coming, it'll really help). I really want to make a good impression on them.<p>Thank you.",1197657866
