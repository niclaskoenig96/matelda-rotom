89628,comment,89525,89525,0,0,mikesabat,,,"Some good advice here.<p>If you feel that you should switch off - then you probably need to. It won't be instant, but you can relax over a few days and be able to clear your mind when you need to.<p>Exercise is essential for me. If you live anywhere other than NYC (where I live) then you can probably do yoga - which is the absolute best. You can also run and meditate. After a week or so you'll have more control over your mind.<p>If you are looking for a cheap shortcut buy and read Be Here Now by Richard Alpert/Baba Ram Dass. I think you have to be under 25 for this to work.",1197660268

89622,comment,89545,89545,0,0,robg,,,"What a fantastic post. <p>One thing I'd like to add: It's extremely difficult to overwrite or unlearn things that have already been learned. You can teach users something new, but if it conflicts with what they already know, they're going to run into trouble and much effort will be expended to overcome the multiple messages.<p>One silly example from my research: We found developmental traces of pre-school knowledge in biology professors. The professors acted like children even though they've had at least 20 years to overcome their early confusions. The simple, bastardized story: The brain doesn't have a delete button and overwrite appears to be very hard. <p>Better to conform to users, because they're not likely to conform to you. At most, pick one thing you want them to learn and the more novel, the more likely they'll ""get it""..",1197659059
