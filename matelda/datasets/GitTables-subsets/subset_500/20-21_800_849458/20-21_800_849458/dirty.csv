There is no reason that this must necessarily entail laws. In many cases simple speechifying and arbitration might suffice. Very often, it would be more appropriate to <i>repeal</i> a law than to pass a new one. Internal consistency is not required (or is a moot point) if there is no code of laws. And while that seems a huge leap from today's situation, it is in principle a possibility.<p>From a more practical perspective, the role that our government has taken is to be seen to <i>do something</i>. For example, the CAN-SPAM law certainly involved passing a law. But that law had no basis in reality; it's utterly impractical and unenforceable. Assuming that our legislators aren't stupid, there was never any requirement that this law be used to prosecute spammers. Rather, the intent was to demonstrate to the public that the government was ""doing something about the problem"". Thus, there was no need to ensure that it was consistent with anything, or even that it had any actual meaning.<p>Thus, it's perfectly feasible for a functional government to have inconsistency in its legal code.",1249505104

744221,comment,742820,742989,0,0,joe_the_user,,,"Currently, the government certainly <i>is</i> 'printing money from the air', ie borrowing and monetizing. We shall see whether the result is consumer-level inflation or not.<p>It's not always true that injecting money into an economy simply result in <i>visible</i> inflation. Such an injection is indeed essentially a wealth re-distribution but if such a re-distribution causes more productive investment when you would have otherwise have people hoarding money, then you have economic expansion. And even more, if such an injection successfully causes the economy to grow, you don't have the same degree of inflation, since a larger store of money is now chasing a larger store of goods and ... it's all good.<p>But this is a hypothetical discussion between the Keynesian and Classical positions. In the case of Cash for Clunkers, I think both schools would agree that we have a Bad Policy. The Classicals would evoke your Broken Window Fallacy while the Keynesians would point out that this is not really increasing socially useful resources.<p>And further, we currently don't have obvious Germany-1920's-style inflation but the real enemy that lead up to the crisis was asset inflation. And the current program is really neither monetarist nor Keynesian but rather simply a process of propping up the same asset-inflationists that organized the previous bubble.",1249505063

I can't imagine the microcode is in an FSM.<p>When I was at CMU, my capstone engineering class was to build a machine that was capable of a small set of tasks (One that I remember was multiply two 16-bit numbers.) We were to optimize for some specific thing -- ours was ""most sleep"" (that is, least work) and ""least wire wrapping."" So it was as simple as possible; entire control path fit in a PLA for example.<p>Anyway, one of the other groups apparently optimized for AWESOME. We were there with our single board and a multicolor cloud of wire-wrap; they showed up with a multiple board computer. The boards had a pair of 68-pin IDC connectors and two huge wide cables as a bus.<p>The machine basically was fully asynchronous and had no clock. One board was an ALU, one was the control unit, etc. For their demo they both ran with one or two ALU boards and got different performance.<p>This was 1995 or so, so quite progressive for the time.",1249503560
