Before you jump all over me, look at the holding.<p>The Court said that it will maintain the CCE standard for invalidity <i>defenses</i>, not plaintiffs' claims of invalidity. It's a fine point, but important one neverhtless.<p>You see, CCE has been the standard for plaintiffs alleging patent invalidity since 1982. It's right in the statute. <a href=""http://openjurist.org/title-35/us-code/section-282/presumption-of-validity-defenses"" rel=""nofollow"">http://openjurist.org/title-35/us-code/section-282/presumpti...</a> . The problem was that Microsoft was trying to reduce the burden of proof for the <i>defense</i>.<p>A weaker burden for defenses is very very bad. That means, even if a plaintiff shows, by substantial evidence, that a patent is invalid, a defendant can just give the minimal amount of defense...and the defendant will win.<p>So, this improves things...a tiny, weeny bit.",1307663953

2639222,comment,2637691,2638719,1,0,petegrif,,,"IMHO you are missing an absolutely critical point and are therefore falling prey to the hindsight effect.\nLet's imagine that you have a brilliant idea right now, one that NOW is not at all obvious.  What does that mean?  It means that NOW (a) there is no prior art (b) there may well be teaching away from the art, in other words, even though the field is a familiar one and you would think it obvious once pointed out, nonetheless there is no evidence that anyone has thought of it before (c) there is no public domain publication or record of a talk etc .... Such evidence is taken as evidence that it is not obvious.  Now let's assume that you take your idea further and turn it from an idea - an insight if you will - into an invention.  That may involve a great deal of time and money.  In some cases it certainly does.  Now let us assume that you release a product and it achieves great success.  The very success of your product means that it will become a part of popular culture and there have been several studies that show that within a remarkably short period of time people take what was your innovation for granted and consider it obvious.  Bear in mind however that it wasn't obvious when you thought of it and when its obviousness was considered, for example, by the patent office.  Failure to recognize this and the associated hindsight effect leads to people making statements about how obvious something is when that is completely irrelevant.  The question is not how obvious it is but how obvious it was.  If a patent is granted it can always be challenged and invalidated if someone is able to demonstrate that there was indeed prior art.  The patent is assumed to have validity but that does not mean that evidence of prior art will just be disregarded, it just means that the evidence has to be clear.",1307663870

But if you start with the ""whole product"" you could lose them before you got to the really interesting parts.<p>Later, if people ask you mundane questions, ""How do I change the create a contact, or edit it"", you can go back and show that just to satisfy them that it really is just that easy, and that they could do it.",1307663413

2639184,comment,2636520,2637301,-1,0,bradleyland,,,"> One could carry the same analogy to level apps, compass apps, music streaming apps (particularly given the iPod and iCloud), etc<p>Yes, because it is a continuum, the argument extends to <i>every</i> type of application, including the outliers I mentioned in my own example. The important point is that some are farther from ""core"" functionality than others. The closer you move to the core, the more risk you assume.<p>In my view, a music streaming app on iOS faces a lot of risk. It's Apple's platform. They don't enjoy a monopoly, so they should be free to set the rules of entry. I've strongly disagreed with their policies in the past [1], but my views don't change the facts. Apple's platform, Apple's rules.<p>This WiFi sync app is particularly high risk, because it's ""plumbing"". Syncing is a low-level function that reasonable person would expect to be provided by a system service. Apple recognizes that this is the reasonable view and denied the original app for their own reasons. Many of which we cannot know, but we can reason. Being such a ""low-level"" service, Apple wants to preserve the user experience. This is very typical Apple behavior. I'm not surprised at all that they would deny the app.<p>The ""ethical"" question is a much more interesting one. It raises the question, ""What are the boundaries of governing your own platform when users have the ability to leave at any time?"" I think Apple bumps up against these boundaries all the time. They have a pretty long history of pushing the limits with their T&Cs, then easing back. Is that ethical? I'm not sure.<p>1 - <a href=""http://www.bradlanders.com/2011/02/21/its-not-greed-its-narcissism/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bradlanders.com/2011/02/21/its-not-greed-its-narc...</a>",1307662534

Venture funds do it full time and are right only 1-in-5 times.  Imagine your favorite city bureaocrat (who gets paid a city bureaucrat wage) trying to figure out if Spotify will be succesful or not.

I had experience running big datacenters previously and it wasn't any more or less difficult.

The strategies are tuned in real-time by the guy that created them (usually). He watches them run and either pauses, modifies, or kills them based on performance.<p>The strategies are a mix of code and configs and run on a bunch of servers. You stick the servers as close to the exchange's (or other third-party's) servers as you can to get as much of a latency edge as possible. We had access to all kinds of advantages in this regard that normal ccompanies wouldn't get.<p>The programming challenges were somewhat more interesting, but I wasn't super involved in that. Things like garbage collection performance tuning (so they could use higher level languages) and hard core math. But a lot of boring stuff too, like dealing with hundreds of legacy data feeds (many of which cost tens of thousands per month).<p>The very core is just really crafty individuals sitting around all day thinking of ways of screwing^Wtaking a slice of other people's pie and turning that into a strategy which can be milked as quickly and for as long as possible.",1307661559

(FWIW, I've been working in ad tech for the last three years)<p>One of the big divides is serving advertisers vs. serving publishers. The Kawaja/Luma Partners slide that is oft cited shows how various companies fit into this divide. Advertiser (or buy-side) tech generally tries to optimize on ROI ... driving revenue per ad dollar spent. On the publisher side, tech tends to be about driving higher impression prices... finding the right buyers for the impressions you serve.<p>Another divide in my mind is tech that is designed for brand advertising vs. tech designed mainly for direct response. Brand advertising is typically what you see in national TV ad spots or in the full page adverts in magazines. The SuperBowl ad spots are emblematic of this. On the other hand, you have adverts that are more about offering a particular product or service with a concrete offer (Two for one, 10% off for referring a friend, etc.).",1307660411
