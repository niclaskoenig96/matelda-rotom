8979001,comment,8978508,8978508,0,0,ahelwer,,,"Tracking down numerical errors is brutal. I worked at a company re-implementing some MATLAB research code into optimized C++ (with parallelization where possible), where output had to match exactly bug-for-bug[1]. The algorithms were obviously very simple compared to weather forecasting on supercomputers, but it was still incredibly tedious dumping & comparing MATLAB debug values at dozens of points across multiple scenarios, each of which took hours to run. We even calculated one of the datasets they gave us would take 86 years(!!!) to process in the original MATLAB code. Sympathy for the team working on this. Fond memories of getting enormous arrays of NaNs after a fix.<p>[1] Bug-for-bug <i>means</i> bug-for-bug. There was a clear attempt to sort an array in the research code, which was implemented as a single pass through the data just deleting elements that were smaller than their direct predecessor. Research code is weird. It&#x27;s one of the few places in software where &quot;hack it till it works&quot; actually produces valuable results.",1422759565

An editorial written by someone who is highly vested in the buy side and who therefore has a clear bias against electronic market makers (which is obvious from the ridiculously incorrect usage of the term front running in the piece).<p>B) The piece is also factually incorrect on the way spoofers are making money on the trade.  They aren&#x27;t making money by tricking an HFT into jumping in front of the wrong order (which is not possible on any exchange that I know of).  They are making money by hiding the true supply and demand of a product and then taking advantage of the other market participants who misprice based on the incorrect market information.<p>That said, electronic market makers are leading the charge against spoofers, as the spoofing trades are explicitly targeting them (and are currently illegal).",1422759491

The only thing that comes to mind that would explain this sort of behavior is if you actually make a copy of the Dictionary first and then access that copy; since it&#x27;s a copy, the conversion would presumably invoke the normal copy-on-write behavior and make a copy of the backing storage, while leaving the original Dictionary un-converted. In that case, any subsequent copy + access would have to re-convert. And if that&#x27;s what&#x27;s going on, then that sounds like expected behavior, not a bug.<p>An example of what I&#x27;m talking about would be something like<p><pre><code>  let dict = self.someDictionary // dict is a copy, not a reference\n  let x = dict[&quot;foo&quot;] // this would then convert\n  let y = dict[&quot;bar&quot;] // but this wouldn&#x27;t\n</code></pre>\nIf you mean that the `let y = dict[&quot;bar&quot;]` would convert as well, then I&#x27;m a bit skeptical, because it seems implausible that the conversion code in Dictionary would even be capable of &quot;converting&quot; a native storage to a native storage (i.e. it&#x27;s reasonable to expect that the conversion code explicitly converts an NSDictionary to a native storage).",1422758685

8978962,comment,8977868,8977868,0,0,henrikschroder,,,"Some random points:<p>1) As an employee in the US you get very little paid vacation per year, and as a consequence, US companies are <i>extremely</i> bad at planning for people being absent for longer stretches of time. Contrast with European countries where everyone takes off for three to four consecutive weeks in the summer, and consequently European companies <i>plan</i> for it and have a much easier time handling people being absent.<p>For longer parental leave to work in the US, paid leave also has to increase, to force companies into coping.<p>> opponents of paid leave say it is an economic burden that can be expensive for businesses<p>2) That&#x27;s a naive and short-sighted way of looking at it. Long paid parental leave creates a happier population, with happier children, which in turn presumably are more productive when they reach working age. Accessing a labour market, <i>any</i> labour market has certain costs. For example, accessing the Silicon Valley labour market is more expensive than accessing the Midwest labour market, but the Silicon Valley one has higher quality potential employees, which justifies the cost.<p>If you think about it, a labour market doesn&#x27;t spring into existence in a vacuum, if you want a pool of college-educated employees, you need colleges, quality high-schools, middle class parents who value education, and economic incentives to make going to college a good idea (i.e. a higher salary for these people). All of this costs money, and the ones paying it are the very companies that want to hire these people.<p>3) In the long run, it&#x27;s very important to switch away from a system of maternity leave to equal parental leave. Women of child-bearing age are routinely discriminated against because companies know that they might quit/focus on the children/work less hours/have long maternal leave etc. By having equal paternal leave, and making sure that men take as much as women, this discrimination will disappear.",1422758164

So I did a quick search for UEFI and Secure Boot and nothing comes up. I see a reference to GRUB (which can be compiled to boot UEFI computers) and rEFIt which is abandoned in favor of rEFInd. rEFInd can support both UEFI and Secure Boot. Any Mac or PC with Windows 8+ is (U)EFI based, and additionally Secure Boot enabled with Windows 8. Yes that can be disabled and then re-enabled to go back and forth between Windows and openBSD, but this is pretty well solved on Fedora, Ubuntu, and openSUSE out of the box. Maybe the best is openSUSE which has the proper chainloader patch to boot Windows from GRUB in Secure Boot mode, obviating the need to go through the firmware&#x27;s boot manager to switch between OS&#x27;s. If openBSD install media lacks UEFI support, it isn&#x27;t a deal killer, however it makes it rather substantially less &quot;out of the box&quot; if this isn&#x27;t just dealt with at install time like it is on at least those three linux distributions.",1422757182

All of these mechanisms come with a built-in avenue for comment. All of these mechanisms also ensure that, unless I know the author directly, someone <i>other</i> than the author thought the post merited reading. This works as a natural feedback cycle if the author cares about impact at all. (And if they don&#x27;t, comments wouldn&#x27;t help.)<p>And as the internet democratizes, perhaps the best feedback mechanism is for commenters to have <i>their own</i> blogs. Nothing requires giving the world a chance to speak at your own pulpit.",1422756031
