However, we are making progress treating cancer, HIV and hundreds of other diseases and bodily malfunctions, and I see little reason to be that pessimistic about treating psychological malfunctions. Just recall how far medicine got in the last 100 years and how much faster research moves forward nowadays than it did during most of that time. Sure, there wont be an easy treatment any time soon, but Im sure that there will be an effective treatment.<p>And even if you think that nanomachines reprogramming the brain are absolutely necessary to treat depression, I can assure you that people work on that, too.",1368176249

And they may be right, but it's not as likely as depression.<p>Here's an acid test that may help you work it out: Studies have been done where people were told they would be given a painful electric shock. This was then administered. They were told a few minutes later that they were about to receive another shock.<p>Normal people would react to the knowledge - as soon as they were told ""We're gonna shock you"" their heart rate increased, etc. Psycopaths registered no change until the shock was actually administered.<p>So: If you knew something was about to inflict real pain on you, would you tense up? If yes, you're most likely depressed.<p>I've been through the ""No feelings at all"" type of depression myself - weirdest part was when my dog died, and I sobbed my eyes out but didn't actually feel any emotion at all on the inside.<p>I had to go through the black hole of abject misery and out the other side before I got my feelings back.

It's like existential-introversion-apathy. I have so many ideas, and things I want to learn and do, yet I'm too content in apathy to act on many of them. I'm in a good job, but when it comes to my personal life I mostly have a blank stare to respond with.<p>Really, I haven't felt like I've been living for myself for a long time. If it weren't for my girlfriend and my family and knowing that they would be completely broken if I wasn't here, I'm not sure I would still be here.<p>I guess this sounds worrisome, but I've felt like this for the past 6 years and have managed so far. It got worse after college, but now I feel like I'm at a lower equilibrium.<p>I've thought about doing something about this, but I really have no idea. I mostly feel _guilty_ that I even have this ""problem"". Are these feelings and thinking patterns really a problem? What can be done about them, if anything? I'm a young 20s working male in America. That's a hell of a good dice roll in the global humanity game which is why I feel guilty even writing and talking about this.<p>I don't know, is this a broken way of thinking?",1368172989
