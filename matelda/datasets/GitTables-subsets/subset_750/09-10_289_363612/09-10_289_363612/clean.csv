Only many other limitations apply when building an actual tower, so you would probably need a lot of engineering to design a tower even remotely close to that height that can be built before it collapses. If that kind of thing was so easy the carbon nano-tubes fiber cable for the space elevator would be a reality and we would be sending packages to the ISS at almost no cost. But if you take a look at the ideas for the project, you&#x27;ll find the amazing problems they are trying to solve just to be able to say: Ok, we can do it.

If you divide that by the mass of a single brick, which is 1.152g, then you get the grand total of bricks a single piece of Lego could support: 375,000.<p>But the weight it can support will be determined by the weakest link not by the average. If the lowest brick is of below average quality the tower will fall sooner. So if you plan on building a 3.5 km tower I&#x27;d advise you to consider the variation of the brick quality. Bonus points for taking into account that each additional brick has to support less weight.",1405589122

And while you&#x27;re at it, just 20 more minutes will give you not only a much deeper consideration for the problem, but also some chilling examples of lives across the world being ruined by a, for all intents and purposes, emerging behaviour.<p>What <i>is</i> true though, is France&#x27;s reputation for its denial of the existence of it (because well, you guys buried all social inequalities after you chopped off the heads of your last kings, right?) and the resulting cognitive dissonance regarding all things bullying. To be fair though, your governments have started recognizing and acting on it a number of years ago (even if it was years after most other member states, but hey, there are plenty of other things that other members states were later than France to adopt, so I&#x27;m not harping on that). But apparently not everybody has gotten &#x27;le memo&#x27; yet - because well, <i>you</i> were never bullied, so it doesn&#x27;t exist in Europe, right?<p>Oh, and because apparently I need to teach you your own language, the word is &#x27;harcelement&#x27;.<p>(for context, I&#x27;m not an American, and also this comment is probably more vitriolic than it should be, but hey - I&#x27;ve reached the breaking point for nationalistic nonsense and &#x27;my experience is x, therefore x is universal&#x27; idiocy on HN, and this post happened to combine them in the most obnoxious way possible).",1405588743

Alas, the problem is not so simple.<p>I don&#x27;t think anyone so far has been able to demonstrate a way to get entropy and reseed the rng after forks, in a manner that <i>always works no matter what</i>, on Linux.  Everyone&#x27;s got criticism, some people have suggestions, and when these suggestions are followed, more pitfalls are discovered.  This is a problem with Linux -- Linux simply does not provide the right APIs and the right guarantees.  Right now, it might very well be <i>impossible</i> to abstract the rng away on Linux like they do on OpenBSD.<p>So is Linux broken?  Well, it sure likes to make things difficult.  It is possible to work around the problem, but you cannot solve it in a library.  No, OpenSSL could not solve it either.  What did OpenSSL then do?  It pushed the responsibility on to the applications, out of the library. <i>Someone else&#x27;s problem.  Not solved!</i>  This might be a viable workaround as long as the problem is properly documented and all applications implement the workaround correctly (which apparently isn&#x27;t the case).<p>OpenBSD isn&#x27;t about workarounds.  Much of what they do is about eliminating pitfalls that <i>do not need to be there</i>.  This translates to less headaches for users & admins as well as developers.  It&#x27;s been demonstrated too many times that developers get things wrong.  The OpenBSD people want to provide simple APIs that just work; ones you cannot use wrong.  If there&#x27;s a function that should provide randomness and the system is capable of providing randomness at all, then that function must work.  Period.  The programmer doesn&#x27;t need to dance around it until it starts working.  And the programmer shouldn&#x27;t need to dance around it every once in a while again to keep it working.

They form a tight-knit community as follows.<p>- home schooling to a new level: kids of all ages and experiences are here. Teach each other in organized classes what you know and is useful, from arts, engineering, math, physics, biology, anything. Basic supervision and occasional classes by the &quot;founding adults&quot;.<p>- self-sustaining: farm some food, raise some animals, with help from on-site professionals. Use technology to improve this and help out those professionals (see below)<p>- BYOS: build your own school. Identify needs of the community (we need a toolshed. we need a water sprinkler system. we need air conditioning...). Learn to raise funds, some from the &quot;founding adults&quot;, some from parents, some from neighboring city. Kids learn to work within a timeline, a budget, scoping projects, designing engineering systems, implementing, and overcoming roadblocks. As a team.<p>- Bring back to the real world: to graduate the institute, they basically have to create something of value to bring back to the rest of the world. Evaluated by a community panel of students, &quot;founding adults&quot; and external visitors/evaluators. This makes them apply what they&#x27;ve learned outside of the bubble they&#x27;ve been living in.<p>- alumni could obviously love this place so much they want to stay on, in which case they transition to becoming &quot;founding adults&quot;<p>Obviously, there are no exams, or mandatory lectures, or homework, or any of that shit.
