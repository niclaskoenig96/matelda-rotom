I've heard that part of the reason for the lower lifespan is increased accidents among lefties due to the clear favoritism for right-handers in the world (one might say reality has a clear right-handed bias).<p>But, I'm left-handed and not <i>too</i> worried about it.  If it were a dramatic difference in lifespan, I guess we'd be even fewer in number than we are.",1218447989

I mean look at ANY site on the web, they are probably in violation of 200 patents. Chances are the ""Add Comment"" button has already been patented. So has the hyperlink I used to view your story. So has the term ""flag""<p>c) Most of these ""patents"" are bullshit.<p>d) There is no guarantee that these guys will even get their patent approved.<p>e) You don't even know what they are trying to patent. For all you know, their patent has nothing to do with their technology, it could just be a patent for something stupid like ""a way to display a hyperlink in a lime green bold times new roman font"".<p>So personally I'd just go ahead and do whatever it is you want to do, because chances are there is prior art that you can cite to make anything they come up with invalid.",1218447938

272880,comment,272671,272671,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I'm going to show my age and say that you will never, ever, find me saying, ""I like working on a laptop better than a desktop machine"".  Big monitor, nice keyboard, big mouse pad, all in exactly the same place every day.  That's what I need to be happy in my computing experience.<p>Almost every other hacker I know prefers a laptop and they're quite content to roam with their work.  I just don't get anything done that way.  I guess I'm just too much of a princess.<p>I can see the argument that one can plug in a proper monitor and keyboard...but why?  My desktop is nearly a year old, and still probably about twice as fast as <i>any</i> laptop anyone in this discussion owns and has more RAM and disk space, and it only cost about $1000 to build.  To get close to the performance of this desktop machine in a lappy, you'd spend $3000 or more (and your memory bus will still be 50% slower).<p>Then again, most of the folks in this discussion aren't compiling software every day...so maybe I'll change my tune when I no longer have that task as part of my core job.",1218447753

272877,comment,272403,272403,0,0,haasted,,,"""The cure is not to reduce the price, but, on the contrary, to raise it even higher to break our addiction to oil.""<p>It is interesting that the prime minister's comment was sensational enough for several Danish news outlets to pick up on the NYT story. This indicates that his comment is far from established policy in Denmark.<p>When our current government was elected, it introduced a stop on new taxes which has been in place since. Having the prime minister talk about introducing an extra tax on already expensive gas is quite newsworthy. Some critics argue that rather than raising the price on gas, the government should consider removing the taxes that are put on environmentally friendly cars and hybrids.",1218447468
272876,comment,272840,272840,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Yes.  Of course.<p>Whenever the question is, ""Is Microsoft trying to make use of their existing dangerously strong positions in order to strengthen their positions in new areas?""  The answer is always, ""Yes.""<p>In this case, however, I just kinda have to chuckle, because it's a battle between two companies who have always been pretty uncomfortable playing on the level playing field of the Internet.  Open standards are not the forte of Microsoft or Adobe, and I don't think I'd lose much sleep over either one of them taking a bit of a beating.  If they want to beat <i>each other</i> up, that's even better.<p>But, I guess if I had to choose between Microsoft and Adobe which one I wanted to be in control of my online video and multimedia experience, I would choose Adobe.  They've been Linux friendly, by some definition of friendly, for at least a few years...though it's always seemed pretty grudging.  And Flash Player aint exactly the pinnacle of software reliability (though it seems to be better lately...and to be fair, I suppose they could be as nasty and evil as RealPlayer and try to do stupidly irritating stuff to my preferences every time it fires up...but then, I guess if they'd been doing that, they'd be in the same ghetto as RealPlayer).",1218446749

You may be able to leverage them for more than money, eg. use them as board members and have them use their network to help you get needed contacts to develop your business.<p>This was an incredibly successful strategy at my previous company. The investors had contacts at some very interesting clients, which allowed the salesmen to get in at a different level than if they had to start from scratch.",1218445977
