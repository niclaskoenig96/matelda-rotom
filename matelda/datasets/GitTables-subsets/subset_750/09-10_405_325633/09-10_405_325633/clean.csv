3665964,comment,3665576,3665953,3,0,dangrossman,,,"> What's to stop someone ... writing off a days worth of cheap merchandise down at the park for a haul of card details?<p>The fact that stolen credit card numbers, even with a full billing address and CVV2 code are still only worth a couple dollars on the black market. Your setup wouldn't even capture that, so your merchandise is probably worth more than the numbers. And you're putting yourself at pretty serious risk of getting caught by running this scam in person, when it's much easier to do some kind of phishing scam online anonymously, with more valuable results.<p>Stolen credit card numbers just aren't very valuable. If you're not living in a nation with an ineffective or corrupt legal system, what are you going to do with the numbers without a high risk of getting caught? Making your own plastic cards and magnetic tracks is expensive and you end up on security camera video using them. Ordering anything tangible online means linking your fraud to your physical location one way or another. You can order a bunch of porn or other intangibles, but that's a pretty low reward for all the risk.<p>In the end, it's a moot point anyway. Normal credit card terminals can be bought on eBay for less than an iPad and can be used for card theft just the same.",1330938896
3665963,comment,3663641,3663641,1,0,kilburn,,,"The algorithms used in this article are _extremely_ bad for the case! Realize that the guy is just trying to find the _longest overlap_ between two strings. This is, the longest part at the end of text1 that is repeated exactly at the beggining of text2.<p>With that in mind, it is _obvious_ that there is an algorithm linear in the size of the overlap to compute it. For instance:<p><pre><code>  def commonOverlapSanely(text1, text2):\n  \tright = len(text1)-1\n  \tleft  = 0\n  \tmaxleft = len(text2)\n  \twhile left < maxleft and right >= 0:\n  \t\tif text1[right] != text2[left]:\n  \t\t\tbreak\n  \t\tright -= 1\n  \t\tleft += 1\n  \treturn left\n</code></pre>\nInstead of using this _very simple_ algorithm, the author employs three different approaches:<p>1. A ""naive"" version that keeps copying increasingly large portions of the original strings, and checking the whole portion each time. This obviously makes the algorithm quadratic in the size of the overlap, thus leading to very bad performance.<p>2. The KMP algorithm, that is designed to search for occurrences of a string within another one, disregarding where. This is a silly thing to do because the resulting algorithm is linear in the size of the longest input string, instead of on the size of the actual overlap.<p>3. An ""indexOf"" monstruosity, that is so wrong it is even hard to explain. Carefuly inspect the code and cry.<p>Now, please tell me if I missed something...",1330938850
