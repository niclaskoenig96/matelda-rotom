Why isn't he just starting startups"". But working at Mozilla gives you a chance to really have an impact on the web at a much higher level. Working on a great tool like firebug or planning out new JS language features has a potentially larger impact....your work could be part of the success of many startups!!",1216382043

Everything takes 10 times longer than it should, and every minute is very painful. I can count on two hands the number of times I've gone out and partied. I don't hack when I have stuff due.<p>I've had the 'perfect point of efficiency' vision in my head for a while, but I'm stumbling on the first block. I have a pretty good head for being organized, but the execution is lacking. I also have ADHD, apparently (I've learnt an awful lot about software engineering by failing to (be able to) follow through plans to do assignments, actually). So in some ways I'm trying to get around the executive functioning problem by doing something that I clearly want to do, instead of something I'm doing because it's what you do when you finish HS.<p>Of course, it might just because I'm dumb. Other people seem to think I'm smart, though (case in point above), and that's the only measure, aside from schoolwork, that I've witnessed.<p>I'm not dropping out to buy time, I'm dropping out to buy a task that I'm more willing to do.",1216379917
249622,comment,247239,248483,0,0,zepolen,,,"Agreed, however the article already acknowledges that approach (read near the end about the flower).<p>Luckily, unlike text, which follows a very constrained set of rules, (eg an X will always be two lines criss-crossed), the same doesn't apply to 3D objects, where you can have 2 images of the same object that look entirely different, a simple example being the chair, that comes in all varieties of shapes but still easily identifiable to a human.<p>So this would automatically require human input in respects to identifying the object, you can't create a program that would 'learn' new objects, at least, not yet.<p>Also, the silouhette strategy can only be applied when a shape remains relatively constant, moving the camera a little to the left would render a completely new silouhette.<p>Add that the bot would still need to be told how to answer the arbritrary 'How many legs does the chair that the man is sitting on have?' questions.<p>The fact that so much human input is required just to identify /one/ object in the captcha, the fact that once that object has been compromised it is trivial to switch in another one (which is impossible in text captcha because there are only 26+10 amount of characters that the whole world knows) means that this is a damn effective captcha.",1216379735

It's incredibly painful, not to mention cutting significantly into time to do anything at all. You can't let yourself go out and meet people - or hack - when you really need to do this assignment for tomorrow.""</i><p>Sounds like you need to work on some self discipline.  If you can get your social life, studies, hacking, and business efforts under control, THEN I would suggest you should go for the monumental jump and ""drop out"".  If you think you'll have more time when your startup takes off, think again.  If you are interested in VC funding at some point, then you might find it challenging when they step in and start calling shots and start telling you directly what you need to do in order to make things successful - some of it might be stuff you will resist in the same way you seem to be resisting your college work.<p>You sound like a young, intelligent, and energetic guy...see if you can get yourself organized such that every  aspect of your college life is organized to the point of efficiency.  If you can accomplish that, then you surely will have the management mettle to make a startup successful.  Self discipline is an extremely important quality when undertaking something ambitious such as a startup.  It seems to me that you should acquire self discipline and other important skills that are not directly related to the technical aspect of doing a startup before dropping out.",1216379555
