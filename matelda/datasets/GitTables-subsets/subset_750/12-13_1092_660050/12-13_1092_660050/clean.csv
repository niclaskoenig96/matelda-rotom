Since I wasn&#x27;t a suspect of anything and they had no warrant, they couldn&#x27;t actually take my bag and search it without my consent. I asked if I was arrested, they said no, I asked if I could then leave, they said no.<p>Eventually they asked for &quot;backup&quot;, even though I wasn&#x27;t offering any physical resistance (I wasn&#x27;t getting arrested after all), and then there were 5 officers grilling me as to why I was refusing an illegal search. I resisted for over 1 hour, then finally I relented and &quot;consented&quot; to the search.",1390741196

Do I think there were some foreign agencies and conspiracies in this? Probably there were. Both Soviet and American. In the end regular people decided. Soviets had the whole country, the army, press, censorship, party, everything. Americans had radio free Europe and Hollywood movies to &quot;brainwash&quot; us.

7124897,comment,7121144,7123652,8,0,Theodores,,,"Also overlooked is the guy we assume to have been trying to commit suicide. He is still a fellow human being, but what possible words do we have for him? Seemingly none on this thread.<p>Things might be bad for the Caltrain engineer, but he still has his job. However, for Mr Failed Suicide, he has the following to look forward to: the problems that existed before the attempt, those will not have gone away. The physical agony of injury due to being hit by a train. A hospital bill. The fact that he is not going to be Mr Popular for indirectly causing someone else to die. Hence, with hindsight, his original depression will look like happy times.<p>In London (and probably every major city) commuters are regularly affected by those trying to commit suicide by being hit by a train. Recently we had one woman on the tracks first thing in the morning. She did get hit, but not fatally. This required a suspension of service. Eventually the authorities caught her and, after being admitted to &#x27;A+E&#x27; (Accident and Emergency), they took her to the mental health ward. After lunch she was able to discharge herself and make it down to the train station where she was able to do the deed just in time for rush hour.<p>Because the trains ended up out of sequence due to her morning capers and because the tracks had to be handed over to the police for them to do their work for afternoon/evening, it meant that she had managed to effectively close the track for the entire day. You can imagine how best pleased the tens of thousands of commuters on that line were.<p>I would not be the least bit surprised if the guy that tried to suicide himself in this story tries to kill himself as soon as he is able to, as per aforementioned London lady. There is a big difference between &#x27;cry for help&#x27; suicide attempts and being on the tracks. There is also a difference between someone standing on a tall building preparing to jump and someone on the tracks. Effectively, with that train coming along it is equivalent to the jumper being in freefall, the point of no return has been passed. I don&#x27;t think that our hero in this story had time to realise that.",1390739776

It&#x27;s quite disappointing but not at all surprising.<p>Last year, I was on a train back to visit my parents place—a little village in quiet commuter-land suburbia. It was late. I had drunk a small amount before getting on the train but wasn&#x27;t drunk.<p>A tall drunk man started shouting at me about how he wanted me to suck his dick. I obviously didn&#x27;t do a good enough impression of a disgusted homophobe by shouting &quot;eww, no&quot;. He twigged that I was actually gay and started shouting abuse at me.<p>He was there with a friend who was leering and laughing along. There were no third parties in the nearby vicinity. So, what did I do? I let the abuse continue and didn&#x27;t put up a fight. I was surprised this was happening - these were grown men, this was a train line going mostly out to quiet middle-class suburbia. There were two of them and one of me—they were bigger and stronger while I have the body of a lifelong sedentary computer programmer; if there were a physical altercation, I&#x27;d come out worse for it. I don&#x27;t want to end up in the emergency room.<p>Should I have stood up to them and told them to stop? To give as good as I get? Yes. It might stop them next time. I certainly want to make the situation better. But in the moment when you are being picked on and attacked, the calculation you make isn&#x27;t the same calculation you&#x27;d make after the event. The flipside is I have seen other examples of homophobic abuse of others and been ready and prepared to step in (hasn&#x27;t been needed).<p>There&#x27;s a sort of frozen moment of panic when you are abused. I&#x27;ve had friends who have had very bad sexist abuse who have said the same thing. I have one friend who is trans and a sexual abuse survivior who goes through far more abuse and manage to stand up to it and live their life. I have great admiration for them, but I don&#x27;t think it is anyone&#x27;s job to go around policing the reactions of victims when faced with discrimination and abuse.",1390739141

European integration support is at least 50% of the population; just before Yanukovych decided not to sign the association agreement it was more than 70% according to polls. People also pay attention to the EU position: if it is welcoming and constructive, EU gains ~20% popularity. The decision of Yanukovych was a shock to a large part of the country.<p>Also I have to admit that for many people Europe is a symbol of lawful and wealthy life among rich and friendly cultures. But symbols often fail when confronted with harsh reality. At the same time there&#x27;s a considerable (more well-to-do) part of population who actually saw Europe and know what they want.<p>But Maidan is now not just about EU, though EU support is relatively high (100 000 people was at the only true _Euro_maidan in Kiev on November 24). Our burning need is to get rid of the current regime. Four years of Yanukovych&#x27;s rule have been time of creeping, steady and all-embracing corruption: economic, business, political, juridical, legislative, social. Nobody thought that this would go so far, even people who voted for Yanukovych.",1390738583
