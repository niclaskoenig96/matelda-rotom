Hackers Non-Hackers alike.<p>Ultimately, wikis, git and the plethora of other IT tools, are here to create better communication, they are social tools, and theory behind them is social, ... i mean, they try to solve many social issues, of trust, communication etc ...<p>Your greatest enemy is pride, just because others dont have your skills, doesnt mean they are ignorant and useless. Be modest ... listen and always try to be non confrontational",1203868514

Last semester, I taught ""Calculus for kids who don't care."" This semester, I'm teaching ""Poker and craps for kids who don't care.""<p>I suspect the only way to avoid this is to work at an engineering school (not necessarily a top one).",1203868230

122504,comment,122412,122477,0,0,xirium,,,"In the 8 bit days, Woz designed the hardware and wrote the firmware. Jobs made sales. In the 16 bit days, Jobs specified design constraints, such as form factor and noise limits which techies solved. Jobs would have been involved in technical decisions in a managerial capacity only. There is a creative process in marketing and suchlike, but Jobs wasn't coding or designing components.<p>That's the issue under discussion. Is it worthwhile to have a non-programmer as a co-founder? Yes, if they have very complimentary skills.",1203867775

122502,comment,122412,122412,0,0,dkokelley,,,"If you're going to go at it with a non-hacker, I suggest finding someone who at least understands the process (maybe one who has written even a small program) so that he will have a respect for what the hacker half does. Likewise I think it would seem easy for a hacker to underestimate the importance of a salesperson, designer, marketer, business developer, etc., so take the time to understand and appreciate this aspect of your startup. In the end, you'll both learn a lot from each other, and you'll have a well rounded and balanced set of founders.",1203867569

122499,comment,122207,122297,0,0,xirium,,,"You could be right about premature optimisation. Shift workers live shorter lives than colleagues doing the same job. So, if you increase waking hours now then you may not increase your total and you might not spend them most productively.<p>Regarding greatness, political office impinges greatly on sleep. Margaret Thatcher was widely known to get as little as four hours sleep on a regular basis. Successive British Prime Ministers age relatively quickly after obtaining office. Unfortunately, I couldn't find any other examples. Therefore, it is likely that examples are outnumbered by counter-examples.",1203865884

A good screenwriter is a good technical person! Compression is important, too, due to the confines of the screenplay (~100 pages).
