395795,comment,395448,395448,0,0,Allocator2008,,,"I have a few ideas:<p>1) Raise the retirement age to 70, that way people have to pay more into the system before they can benefit.<p>2) Expand work training programs for college age kids so instead of going to college, kids have a choice to learn skills, like tech certifications for example. These programs could even be funded by tech companies, who would get a tax benefit perhaps for doing it, and also would have the benefit of having a ready-made pool of interns, and competent interns are nearly impossible to get these days I have noticed. This way, kids could go right into the workforce, and not be burdened by loans from a worthless degree.<p>3) Move away from the model of getting a 30 year mortgage, which over-burdens young people. Rather, develop low-cost, pre-frame housing, and make that as an available alternative to the traditional mortgage. It is easier to finance a 30K pre-frame home, then a 150K fossil that may or may not appreciate in value over the decades.<p>4) Re-work tax shelters like the 401K and the ROTH IRA to compell people to have at least 25% of their contributions into money market accounts. This keeps liquidity in the markets, and makes sure people don't completely shoot themselves in the foot with risky investments. If people want to forgo the 25% short-term investment rule, then they get to forgo the tax benefits too.<p>5) Shift the focus in medicine from long-term care to prevention. For example instead of millions going into experimental chemotherapy drugs that may or may not work, shift at least some of that into gene research which could highlight the risk factors for things like cancer, and so on. For example, certain countries in Asia like Japan are known for their longevity, and probably don't put more into healthcare costs than we do, but their nutrition is far better - sushi is healthier than pizza, bottom line. Focus on prevention saves lives, keeps people healthy, and lowers costs of geriatric care.<p>6) Get over the western suspicion of robots. Robots can be great for low-wage jobs that we might not have the manpower to fill as people age, and also can be great caregivers for the elderly. Japan knows these things: they use robots in place of factory workers if they cannot find people for those roles, and also, they are moving towards using robots for caring for the shut-in elderly. Again, this is cost effective. Forget the Hollywood crap about robots and realize they are an economically practical tool to serve man.<p>7) Have an age-indexed social security tax, so people in their 20's and 30's pay less, but this increases in one's 40's and 50's and up until retirement. This keeps the tax burden off the young when they are getting started but ultimately brings in more revenue to the system, if properly indexed.<p>8) Don't stiff NASA. Going to the moon, mars, and beyond stimulates technological advances, which stimulates industry, which stimulates jobs and opportunities. Ultimately the solution for the burden on the young lies in opportunities. Howard Roark can save his generation, but only if he is in an environment that rewards, rather than stifles, creativity and innovation.",1229100168

395782,comment,395535,395535,0,0,mdasen,,,"I just want to point out some flaws:<p>1. Democrats will hate it.  Because the unions will hate it.  The unions get the average worker $65,000 per year plus benefits.  They don't want to give that up because it's an awesome average wage and the benefits are fit for a king.<p>2. ""I’m pretty sure the costs of paying for food, clothing and shelter are much lower than the proposed, but failed, 15 billion.""  Let's do a calculation.  GM alone has 142,000 workers.  A modest salary for a single person could be as low as $10,000.  That's $1.42bn in the first year.  Really, the salary has to be at least $30k.  That's near poverty for a small family.  Worse, these workers have been spending like they're making $65k, maybe $100k.  You're pulling the rug out from under them.  Anyway, at a minimum it's $4.3bn in the first year for GM alone.<p>3. It would create shortages.  Prices would spike like the US has never seen before.  GM sells about 4.5M vehicles a year to Americans.  Toyota sells 2.3M.  So, GM is selling about double the vehicles in the US as Toyota (so much for your theory of cars that don't sell well).  No one could make up that number of vehicles should GM, Ford and Chrysler suddenly cease making cars.  Prices of cars would be out of control.  All of a sudden, you have a population that wants to buy 7M vehicles with only 2M for sale.<p>4. Most people can't engineer anything.  An assembly-line worker will not be able to engineer something.<p>5. Car factories are designed to make cars, not solar panels in the same way that a screwdriver can't access the internet.<p>6. Engineering something takes a lot of time.  To make a car, it might take the better part of a decade with a highly skilled team.  Well, I'm sure that GM with its engineers and focus on the Volt has just been stalling.  A team of 50 with no background in engineering would make an electric car faster, say in a century or two.  What takes GM several years will be near impossible for these teams.<p>7. ""Former administrative assistents [sic] role up their sleeves and do paint jobs. The catering lady designs a logo. And a senior assembly line worker finally seizes the opportunity to learn how to program the order picking robot."" Even simple things like this take time to get good at.  We don't want crap.  An assistant painting will not be as good as what GM does now.  An assembly line worker learning new things will take time and likely won't be as good as the person who does it now.  Quality would be lower than what GM has now for a decade at least.  People can't magically do any job.<p>8. Boot camps cost money.  If this is to be a real program, we're talking a cost of at least $10,000 per employee and moving that adds another $1.4bn for GM alone.<p>9. The boot camp couldn't exist.  Universities already do something.  They don't just sit on their hands.  You can't simply reallocate things because you think you have an interesting idea.  Are you going to transport professors from the northeast to Michigan, Ohio, etc.?  What about when they refuse?  Force them?  What about students at their schools?  They get a year off?  What you're talking about is moving capital (professors) from where they are most effective (universities) to a place that they are less effective.  It's a loss!<p>Really, there isn't a single good idea in the proposal.  I don't like to be so negative, but it's the truth.  I'd say the big 3 probably directly employ 250,000 (GM we know employs about 150k and Chrysler and Ford definitely employ at least 100k combined so this figure is REALLY conservative).  That means that, in the first year, it would cost the government $7.5bn in salaries alone assuming you could get people to take a pay cut over 50%.  Your idea is off by many, many, many orders of magnitude.<p>Think of it this way.  What's stopping you from creating solar panels?  It isn't access to an automotive factory.  What's stopping you from designing a car?  Maybe lack of access to a factory prevents you from building it, but it doesn't prevent you from designing it.  C'mon.  Do it!  Design that electric car!  You're smarter than assembly-line workers.  If assembly-line workers can do it, why can't you?  And do it prompt, before Chevy gets the Volt out in 2010.  If you want an electric car, one is coming.  The only argument for your plan is if one of these 50 person teams can do it faster.<p>Well, I just got to the end, and I see that, of the workers you only want to save 1,500 jobs.  Classy.  Between GM, Chrysler, Ford and their dealerships, that's at least a million people now claiming unemployment.  And while that might not show up as a bailout cost, it's a cost.  Sorry, your plan costs well in excess of $30bn in the first year alone.<p>You say things like that in a couple of years some would be able to support growth.  Let's say they all tripled in size in 3 years.  Now they're employing a whopping 4,500 people.  Really, most would probably just die.<p>This sounds like the thoughts of the new computer programmer: the problem is easy and the old code looks ugly so I can just redo this in a matter of months and it will be a million times better.  In non-computer industries, the problem is even harder.  Seriously, engineer a seatbelt.  It's not complicated, but you're working on a piece that has been solved by someone else and it takes time to make sure it doesn't jam, adequately provides safety, etc.  Cars can't work like computer programs.  A kinda working car kills people.<p>What you're talking about is throwing away at least $100bn over the next few years in government funds and seeing the price of cars triple leading to uncontrollable inflation the likes of which the US has never seen with total economic loss in the $10-100T range.  This would be one of the largest economic problems the world had ever seen.",1229099507

395778,comment,394609,395758,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I take issue with some of your observations.<p>It's true that Germany sent Uranium to Japan as their defenses collapsed. That was 25 March, 1945. German forces surrendered about six weeks later, around 5 May. The Captain, Feher I believe, surrendered to Allied Powers following orders for all U-boats to surrender (insert interesting tangent here) Assuming he would have violated orders and made it to Japan, it would have only meant Japanese would have had Uranium in mid 1945. The first working nuclear bomb was detonated at the Trinity site in July 1945, just a few weeks later. The United States bombed japan in August, just a few weeks after that. There has been no significant evidence that the Japanese were anywhere near capable of using the Uranium to construct a working bomb in those 8-10 weeks. And even if they had, industrial production in the states would have landed a dozen nuclear bombs on Japanese soil for every one they could have built.<p>It's also true that the Japanese feared the Russians more than the United States, but Japan was a complex cauldron of interests at that time. For instance, the surrender recording by the Emperor had to be smuggled out of the Palace because military elements would have destroyed it if they had found it. So simply saying that they would not have surrendered solely due to the atomic bombings is misleading at best. Oddly enough, you're over-simplying it. There were many interests in Japan, and the interests of surrendering to the United States won out. At the end of the day, it was the emperor's call, and the diplomatic service won out over the military.<p>History is complicated, yes. The British performed against the Germans in a way that lent credence to Churchill's statement that this was ""our finest hour"". But there was also lease-lend, and lots of loans, and secret help from the United States. FDR realized the war was coming but had to wait until American popular opinion realized it as well. There was also Hitler's mucking around with the execution of the air war, diverting bombing raids from airfields (where they were devastating) to civilian targets, where they inflicted terror but were militarily not as significant.",1229099366

The NY Times had an analysis showing that most of the difference in ""labor costs"" between Big 3 and foreign makers was due to higher retiree benefits.",1229098669

395758,comment,394609,395393,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"Agreed, the only reason there even was a US atomic bomb so early was because the US military intercepted multiple uranium shipments bound for Japan. When Germany fell they tried to get enough refined material for the Japanese to get the bomb first so the war would be won by their allies and not their enemies. Fortunately the US Navy had recovered enough by that point in the war to hunt down the U-Boats.<p>If the US Navy hadn't recovered so quickly after Pearl Harbor, and if the Enigma Code hadn't been cracked then we'd all be hailing the Emperor of Japan right now. I mean the first nuclear test wouldn't have been in the middle of a desert, it would have been over mainland China. The USSR would likely have never invaded Japan, keeping their neutrality pact alive would have meant the Japanese would have had free reign to attack anywhere they saw fit.<p>The whole of WWII is extremely complicated. I mean the reason for the whole delay in the Japanese surrender to the US after the atomic bombings was because they didn't plan to, until the USSR invaded Japanese territory, breaking a neutrality pact and covering almost as much land in days as the US had managed in months. The Japanese were afraid of being conquered by the USSR because of the atrocities they committed against Russians at the start of the war. So Japan didn't surrender to the allies, they surrendered ONLY to the USA so they would have to be protected from the Russians, incidentally because they knew the US had the A-Bomb they knew it would have to be used in their protection if Russia kept invading.<p>So just the simple 'the A-Bomb won the war' theory is a billion times more complicated than the lay person understands. Hindsight is 20/20, but you're still as blind as the point of view you're looking from. The American POV for the war is very blind of what truly happened during the war compared to the British POV; I'm British and when studying history we were taught that because the US was so late coming into the war it was solely the British Navy and RAF keeping the German Navy from expanding out into the Atlantic. If it wasn't for the British then it wouldn't have been Pearl Harbor, it would have been a full-out invasion by the Germans long before anyone even dreamed of D-Day.",1229098277

Is government money more efficiently spent propping up the auto companies a little bit longer, or giving it directly to all of the people laid off after the auto companies go under?  As others have described in this discussion there is a real possibility of damage quickly spreading to other parts of the economy in a downward spiral if the automakers go down.  So there might be a lot of people in need of that ""fraction"" of the money needed to keep the auto companies going a little bit longer.<p>The decision rests on how we weigh the specific costs and risks involved for each option.",1229098125

Take a look at IP4, for example.  IP6 just isn't getting traction because the problems it solves have now become ""features"" to many people.  (NAT being one of the big ones, since it's gotten the perception of being a security feature.)  My job involves working with IE 6, since my organization refuses to update our systems to even use IE 7, much less standards-compliant stuff like Chrome or Firefox.<p>Simply put, if MS was sent to trial for ""crimes against humanity,"" the jury of ""peers"" who would to be selected would acquit them.  Why?  Because the court would likely consider ""peers"" to be end users, business men or the ignorant, not developers or technologists like us.",1229097772
