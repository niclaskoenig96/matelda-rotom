I honestly don't mind the ads so much, especially since I know TV requires money to make and these fund the various projects out there. It's good for my hard drive free space too, since I don't want TV shows taking up space after I've watched them once.<p>Two suggestions for them:<p>1)Make Hulu videos downloadable through some kind of player like the BBC has. I commute on trains a lot and don't have mobile internet access, but would love to spend the time being entertained by TV.<p>2)Post entire seasons of various series. For instance, I recently began watching the Office and have worked my way through seasons 1 - 3, watched 5 on TV and am currently watching 6. I can't watch season 4 unless I rent/borrow it (which isn't a huge deal, but what's the big deal about posting old episodes anyways?

The e-mail address is used for activation and we had huge numbers of unactivated accounts. I don't have the exact numbers any more, so this is from memory: when we added another e-mail field and checked if they were the same, the number of unactivated accounts halved.<p>Currently, the number of unactivated accounts is consistently between 10% and 20%, so that should give you an indication on how much it saved us.<p>I can only assume that for passwords the problem of typos is worse, since you can't proofread.",1237824767

As far as I can tell it has no URL but I thought it was worth posting:<p>THE THIRD WAY: BETWEEN NUMBERS WORSHIP AND ARTISTIC INSTINCT<p>One of Google's visual designers apparently quit in despair over having to\nprove every tiny graphics decision with clickthrough data, instead of\nhaving management rely on his artistic instinct:<p>> http://www.kottke.org/09/03/google-and-design<p>I'd argue that both approaches are wrong. Moreover, it's a false dichotomy\nto choose between numbers and art.<p>The third way is called insight, and is found through qualitative\nresearch.<p>Of course, in reality, the very best design blends all 3 methods:\nqualitative insights, hard numbers, and pure aesthetic taste. But I think\nthat qualitative should be the driving factor.<p>It's obvious why taste shouldn't be the overriding factor: countless\nwebsites look great but don't sell. You have to moderate pure art with\nwhat customers need.<p>It may be less obvious why the hard numbers should be secondary to soft\ninsights. The reasons are that (a) you may measure the wrong thing, and\n(b) even if you measure the right thing, such as conversion rate, you can\nsub-optimize individual screens while undermining your long-term strategy\nand overall user experience.<p>Putting A/B Testing in Its Place:\n > http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20050815.html<p>Risks of Quantitative Studies\n > http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20040301.html<p>To take the example of which of 41 gradations of blue to pick for a design\nelement: yes, one of these will have the highest clickthrough rate, and\nthus be the local optimum for the design of that one page. But it's quite\npossible that another shade would be better for the overall look of the\nsite and make the complete set of pages feel more like a coherent user\nexperience, which would enhance user confidence and the site's\ncredibility, and lead to long-term loyalty, as more people return to buy\nnext year.<p>And more important, while the best shade of blue might generate 0.1% more\nbusiness than the second-best, it's almost certainly the case that there\nis some other aspect of the design that would lead to 50% more business if\nyou could identify it. To do so, use qualitative research to observe deep\nuser behaviors.<p>The things you know to measure are rarely the ones with the big impact.\nThe things you DON'T KNOW are the place to focus usability efforts.",1237824143
