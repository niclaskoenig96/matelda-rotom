You could build parts out of metal on one of the machines (which could also build parts out of plastic), but you could not build parts out of both materials at the same time.<p>zCorp parts are extremely fragile, but can be cured hard (but are still more fragile than the other machines), and, at least at the time, it was one of the least accurate machines (but also was much cheaper and used much cheaper materials). The highest quality machines used lasers to either cure resin or melt a powdered form of the material. Both machines and materials were expensive.<p>In nearly all cases, significant post processing of parts was required to have anything usable when you were done. These are not like printers, where when you're document is done, you hand out copies. When you're part is done you sand. When sanding is done, you cure and/or seal.",1225560507

When the socially engineered 'everyone is a winner' generation AKA Generation-Y realises real life bears no relation to the one they are taught in school and increasingly college/university, we may be in for a shock.

That'll make'em work harder!<p>But seriously:<p>In software engineering, my colleagues don't want to be managers.  When I worked in IT, they did want management.  I think this difference is a function of the work satisfaction, pay differential.  If you make six figures already (most of my software engineer friends do or are close to that figure), there just isn't enough motivation in a few more grand to become a manager.<p>When will corporations understand that they have made work all about money and therefore have to pay.  There is no loyalty, no sense of sticking it out during rough times.  So all we can afford to value is the cash.<p>That's not our fault.  And I'm not a slacker because of the changing value system I had nothing to do with.",1225559826

I dreaded going in because while I got to enjoy smoke breaks, the entire time my work cell was going off, emails coming in, people needing more and more.<p>The work world is getting grueling.  Whoever said this fast paced culture was right, but Japan isn't the only culture experiencing work-related jetlag.
