I think it is more likely that both Stephenson and Doctorow were programmers earlier in their careers (implied in their Wikipedia articles -- Doctorow founded a software company and Stephenson switched to a physics major so that he could ""spend more time on the university mainframe"").  And once you know a text editor really well (<i>any</i> text editor, even Word), it is simply most efficient to keep using it; there are apparently still professional writers who won't use an editor that lacks WordStar keybindings.<p>However, it would not surprise me at all to learn that there is significant overlap between ""people who learn to program"" and ""people who want to write sci-fi novels"".

For example, in the MySQL Replication Limitations section, they don't even mention how Oracle does it differently.  For example, if not async replication, do you do synchronous replication?  So, when one change needs to be made, you hold everything up until it can be replicated?  You're claiming ""zero-data loss capability"".  That isn't possible.

So nearly zero. I'd imagine, though I'm not sure, that most people on HN have a bachelor's or better and thus most of us are at a lesser risk of unemployment than others. I think when this number changes we will know it's fundamentally different from other recessions that we've had in the last 30 years.<p>It's the rest of the population that takes the brunt of the economic downturn. Recently there has been reverse immigration, people leaving the US^^. And most of the people that are being hurt by unemployment don't have proper skill sets to just get another job.<p>I know a number of internationals working in the US and they are all still employed and in demand. Most people think that people on Visas are at risk. In fact I think there are plenty of jobs for the well qualified. Most of the professional Visa / Green card holders in the US got here because they were uniquely qualified - and that doesn't change with an economic downturn. There is, especially from my perspective, still continued demand for good IT people and good programmers^^^. Against popular belief but understood here at HN; not all programming jobs are outsourced. But many high schoolers and their parents believe this, so there are less people going into tech. This, of course, is good news for those of us who are already in tech. It also does a great job protecting us from economic downturns compared to other fields.<p>The WSJ, as usual, is out to sensationalize business as much as possible. I like the WSJ and read it regularly. I try to take it with a grain of salt. They'd like to have you believe the economy will never turn around.

Companies like Digg & Facebook, it is my belief, don't even have IPO even on their radar.<p>He is 100% right when he says that ""building a product and building a business around a product are two very different things"".  This is the problem that Web 2.0 companies realize after they start and gain critical mass.  Sustaining that growth rate costs significant capital regardless of what open-source technologies or inexpensive hosting platforms you build upon.<p>The real problem, in my eyes, is that VCs and other investors see the critical mass first and dump loads of cash into these startups without demanding a viable revenue model and I don't mean relying entirely on AdSense revenue.  While Adsense can be a good starting point to generating some revenue it should not be looked upon as a means to an end.<p>The problem with Web 2.0 companies is that they all have one underlying theme in their business plans.  Gain traction, obtain substantial outside investment, and then move on to something else by selling out to the highest bidder.<p>While I do believe that companies like Digg and Facebook could generate substantial revenues, what is their motivation right now to do so?  Investors continue to dump money into them and investors are fighting to own a piece of their ""empires"" without viable revenues so why deviate from that course.  Right now they are only looking to grow that critical mass further and eventually look for the highest bidder that will move the founders to the next project.<p>Web 1.0 companies (or pre-bubble burst companies) saw IPOs as a viable means to an end.

I don't buy that spell check is that annoying.  You can turn it off, and novelist specific tools claim not to be distracting, though I haven't tried any.  Is emacs really that much better for creative work or do they want to appear smart/cool by using the same tools as the ""hackers"" they write about?",1231528570

Later, I regret that and don't allow more people to download the source.  You (as someone who has downloaded it) can still forever use, transmit, etc. it under the GPL.  So, people that want a copy of the source can get it from you even if they can't get it from me - and there is absolutely nothing that mandates I continue to give out the source if it's mine.  I then add to it and make a cool Project 2.0 that's closed only and based off that old GPL code.  That's perfectly fine.<p>However, let's say that I took some GPL code, modified it and distributed it.  Now the codebase isn't all my code - it's also partly one or many other people's code.  I can stop distributing it all together, but I can't distribute it and not the source code.  BUT, what if part of my 2.0 closed source version development was eliminating all the GPL code from it!  Then I can make it closed.<p>Basically, if the copyright is <i>your</i> copyright, you have free range.  You can't take away the rights of someone who already has the code under the GPL, but you can stop the GPL thing from going forward (unless the community builds a better fork off your old GPL code).  However, if you're using other people's code in your program, you're stuck with the GPL unless you can get the authors of the other code to exempt you.<p>So, he can't un-open-source the contributions of the other people, but he could replace them.  One of the flaws in the GPL is that you have to wait for one of the author's whose copyright is infringed to sue.  Courts have sometimes held that intended third party beneficiaries have standing, but that's a lot more murky since you're then claiming that the original author created something for your benefit that an intermediary is stopping you from using.",1231528494

426971,comment,426611,426847,0,0,scott_s,,,"I found it fascinating. He makes a compelling argument - with evidence - that humans have a natural instinct not to kill each other. I had never thought about it in the way he presented it, and it changed how I look at wars and killing in general. His followup to that, how one of modern military training's main purposes is to overcome that natural instinct, also changed how I looked at training and practice of any kind.<p>His interviews with veterans who had killed was both fascinating and heartbreaking.<p>Regarding media, one point he makes that I agree with is the non-chalance with which people kill in movies and tv is ridiculous. Not offensive, just fantasy. It did change how I view killing in entertainment. Simply, in reality, most people won't kill.<p>What I didn't buy was his final argument, which tries to argue that the rise of violence in media has contributed to the rise of violence in society. I did not find his evidence convincing. He just spent an entire book arguing for the value of conditioning through actual training, then claims that <i>viewing</i> violence is enough to make someone do it. Unfortunately, this claim is what Robert Grossman is most famous for. I think that's sad, because the rest of the content are things I think all of society should know, in particular those who know someone who has served.<p>A note on the writing itself: not the greatest. In many ways it reads like someone's term paper. He also tries to make connections to the fuzzy-wuzzy side of psychology at times. But that doesn't stop the rest from being good and worth your time.<p>Honestly, I'd rather ask <i>you</i> what you thought about it. I've never been a soldier, so I'm fascinated to know what soldiers feel about it.",1231527884
