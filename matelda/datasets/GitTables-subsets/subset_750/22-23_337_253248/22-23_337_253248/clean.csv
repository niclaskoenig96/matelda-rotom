I've also applied for news writer positions and just a couple of journalism jobs in print/Internet media.<p>If you're asking what I was looking for money wise? I was in a market around 150 (DMA rank), in a city that was very cheap to live in. I had student loans of $800/month, and I'd like to be able to pay them, afford rent, water, power, food, and an Internet connection. I managed that in a cheap city with a roommate at 30k, so I'd like to make more in a larger city, given I have five years experience producing and five in the studio.<p>Which do you think unlikely? Me finding another job at all, or me finding a job that pays a wage approaching middle class?",1350255385

4652896,comment,4652150,4652813,4,0,dkokelley,,,"While burning off excess speed is one major concern for this approach, I've always wondered what it would take to use a balloon like this one to get past some of the tricky parts of rocketry like dealing with atmosphere and carrying extra fuel to carry the extra fuel you are carrying. If you could launch a rocket from 40km (roughly the height of the balloon), you're 25% into the minimum LEO, and ~10% of the way to the ISS. More importantly, the fuel savings from launching at a higher altitude are exponential, because each meter of altitude is one meter of less atmospheric drag (with diminishing returns) and the corresponding fuel/weight savings from not having to carry fuel to travel the first 40km.<p>I would imagine that the current limitations on doing something like this are related to the maximum weight a hot air balloon can lift, in addition to the untested physics and engineering of a mid-air space launch. Imagine if SpaceShipOne (which was launched at 13.3km) could be taken to 40km and then launched.<p>Perhaps someone with a better understanding of lighter-than-air lift physics could explain what the current limitations on this are.",1350255126

If you don't have a lot of context regarding, say, literature from <i>Paradise Lost</i> and Shakespeare to 1921, you're going to find the point very hard to see. If you do, then the novel can be sublime.<p>Joyce was writing during the time we now call Modernism, and the Modernists really broke the link between popular and critical success / pleasure, and we've been living with the results, as a culture, ever since.<p>If you're curious about these issues, Peter Gay's <i>Modernism</i> is a decent place to start.",1350254657

His claim is that the only reason to have those policies is to mitigate SQL injection and because you're storing cleartext passwords.<p>If you're storing password hashes, you don't care about the charset used for the password, and the only limitation on password length would be sane bandwidth concerns - who really cares if I send you 2 or 3Kb of password if your hash algorthm is going to store that in the same sized database column as ""password123""?<p>Either they have those policies for a reason - they've got bad password storage practices, or they have them for no good reason - which is a very good excuse to ask ""WTF?""<p>And do you _really_ think this might have ""cut down on widespread security outbreaks""? That's a pretty lame justification in my opinion - it's like claiming I'd be ""improving my users security"" by disallowing vowels in passwords, to minimise the risk that they re-use existing passwords. There is no way to ""enforce a unique password"" without keeping too much knowledge of users passwords.<p>I think the OP's stated ""concerns"" are very valid, and I agree with him that Rackspace's policies and answers fall a long way short of providing the reassurance that they're storing critical security credentials in a safe fashion.",1350254255

However, I feel like creating, and iterating the message on this landing <i>is</i> time spent focusing on the app store marketing I'll end up using as well as time spent improving my pitch to journalists. Case in point: this is my first attempt at pitching the concept of Wanderous and, over the past hour reading everyone's comments, I've learned that it was pretty much a failure. This is a good thing. An <i>amazingly</i> good thing. Because if this was the pitch I started sending to journalists the concept would not be communicated clearly and my promotion efforts would flop.<p>When I say ""gem"" or ""point of interest"" people are thinking ""single restaurant"" or ""single attraction"" The key part of my pitch that I'm screwing up is that Wanderous is about <i>neighborhoods</i> or simple <i>scenic areas</i> in general. The POIs are algorithmically determined by high densities of shared photo geotags and other social activity.<p>So for example, there are 100 POIs in San Francisco. One of these hundred is called ""Nob Hill"" and happens to be 1 block from Granite Rock Climbing Gym... but Granite Rock Climbing Gym doesn't rank in the top 10 most popular sub-places in my Nob Hill POI (eclipsed by Grace Cathedral and other famous/notable buildings).

That kind of comment would be appropriate for Reddit or Slashdot but generally not for HN unless the irony was particularly insightful. For example, one could use irony as a device to point out the flaw in a particular argument. Banal sarcasm yields no such insight. Had there been a ""Seriously though..."" part with something that contributed to the discussion, I would not have downvoted.<p>If everyone here made that style of comment would HN be a better place? For example, maybe half the comments here can be variations of ""I don't even read Ars Technica"", ""That was the worst ever article, a new low for Ars demonstrating how it's going downhill fast from its complete failure"", ""Anybody who reads Ars is probably a Romney lover"", ""Ars is the worst site ever... I've been reading every article daily for years and it hasn't improved"", and so on. In fact, replace Ars with HN and let people make all those comments about every article. This place might gradually devolve into YouTube comments as people learn through example what types of comments the community values.",1350252332

Based on your feedback as well as others I definitely need to do a better job explaining the concept.<p>>When would I use it? What would I use it for?
