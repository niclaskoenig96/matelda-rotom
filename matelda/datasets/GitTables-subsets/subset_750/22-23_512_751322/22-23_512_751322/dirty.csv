I'd recommend you to proceed and build your app till you are better than your competition (if this is what you are really passionate about building). The space is crowded and there are ~100 goal apps in fb. However, the best one beat the rest by a clear mile and I didn't even have second thoughts about using it. Note that I wouldn't use any other app right away for the following reasons:\n1. go4it provides me all features I need. Some other tool should provide me with awesome features that I would definitely want to use. \n2. I wouldn't want to copy all my goals, timelines, progress and comments into a different tool.<p>For new users these factors won't apply. When you reach a point where you are better than the rest, provide screenshots (similar to yammer) of how everything works in your application and what's better. In my case, I had to install each app to try it and it was frustrating.<p>>> As you can imagine, it is always a bit hard to discover a new competitor when you put some effort in your idea.<p>- I can't really imagine this happening and I strongly disagree with this.

Whitespace, ""public static void main"", sigils on variable names, and so on may look weird when you aren't used to them, but they don't detract from the programming experience.<p>What matters is how many tokens you need to say something simple.  Say you have a list of words, and you want to sort it by length.  That's one line of code in Perl, Python, Ruby, Common Lisp, Haskell, etc.  It is not one line of code in Java.<p>When every simple concept in your program requires a new class with a new file, it just becomes unmanageable, even with the best tools.  That's why I can't be productive in Java.  (Java also doesn't allow quick hacks; private is private, so fuck you.  This means that prototypes have to be ""as good as"" the real implementation, which simply means that you don't prototype.  The resulting software sucks accordingly.)<p>But anyway, I know you have a pretty good app written in Java.  I would like to hear more about how you deal with it sometime.",1256164995

Think about it, we got Heroin, Crack, Meth and the rest from the unrelenting pursuit of lesser forms of mind altering substances, Opium being the first. Soon after opium’s prohibition Heroin made its debut.<p>All this war has done is victimizing individuals who have made poor choices and empowered those who are willing to take the risk to traffic in the substances.<p>Now I agree that drugs have the ability to ruin peoples lives, but that argument is negated by the acceptance of alcohol which has just as devastating of an impact on an abusers life. One must willfully ignore the fact that alcohol abuse, for all intents and purposes, happens in only a small percentage of the population (we are not talking about college party years here but rather life long abusers). As well as, the fact that given it’s availability stronger forms of the substance (liquor) make up for the smallest portion of consumption.<p>If weaker forms of these substances where available (opium, coca) then I believe that you would see a similar trend.<p>Now I am not a government conspiracy nut and I don’t think there is this grand conspiracy to control drugs.

Even if you want the JVM libraries, there are better ways.<p>Yeah, it's an opinion, but it's one from someone with the aforesaid experience in a lot of languages.

Java is a language that simply loathes great code.<p>Besides, you seem to have missed the core point that optimizing the language for a case that doesn't come up often is a misfeature, no matter how you slice it.

Erlang's native representation for dicts is extremely hostile as a term to send to other languages:<p><pre><code>    Erlang R13B01 (erts-5.7.2) [source] ...etc\n\n    Eshell V5.7.2  (abort with ^G)\n    1> dict:from_list([{""abc"", ""def""}, {""efg"", ""hij""}]).\n    {dict,2,16,16,8,80,48,\n          {[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]},\n          {{[],\n            [[""efg"",104,105,106]],\n            [],[],[],\n            [[""abc"",100,101,102]],\n            [],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[]}}}\n</code></pre>\nThat's a hash with two entries, abc -> def and efg -> hij. Note that's the internal representation; dumping out a perl hash gives you a semantic-level representation but under the hood it too has dirty nasty bits like that.<p>If that's not easy, that's a big price to pay for moving binaries around, in general.

You're assuming people, on average, working in web applications are <i>way</i> better informed about the infrastructure of the Internet, or much better at intuiting how a system like DNS might work, than they actually are.  I've been supporting non-technical users who are building things on the web for a dozen years now.  I'm no longer surprised by the capability of people (even smart people who build cool things) to misapprehend how their systems are talking to the rest of the world and how others are finding them.<p><i>Performance:...I don't buy that there are serious performance problems with server selecton.</i><p>I generally agree.  DNS is an incredibly low demand task, and even a modest server can serve millions of queries per day.  No argument there.<p>That said, DNS is a latency cost that echoes through every service.  And some free DNS services <i>are</i> notably slower than a server you run yourself would be.  Doubling the latency of DNS queries can add measurable latency to a first load (where you might lookup a dozen names for images, media content, ads, etc.).  People do care about shaving a second off of a page load time.<p>But, yeah, performance is mostly irrelevant.  The bigger problem is just that we see folks using those kinds of services as a substitute for actually understanding DNS.  We get a disproportionate number of queries from users using third party DNS services, and they tend to be of the really stupid, has no concept of DNS at all, variety.<p><i>You're wrong about the security implications of BIND, though.</i><p>I will certainly not argue with you on security questions, since it is not my area, and I have a lot of respect for your opinion on security issues.<p>But, I was unaware of any exploits in current BIND versions.  According to the BIND security advisories page there have been two security advisories this year; one a DoS and the other was actually an issue in OpenSSL.  And, most importantly, there have been no root or user-level access exploits.  That seems to me to be a pretty good security record.<p>OpenSSH (which we all trust and consider ""secure"", I guess?) tends to have about one major security issue per year...so if OpenSSH is considered secure, then it seems fair to consider BIND pretty secure, as well.  There are probably ""more secure"" DNS servers (and djbdns may be one of them), but I'm not really competent to make those kinds of judgements, so I trust my OS vendors to choose reasonable defaults for this kind of thing.  And, BIND is the default DNS server on every OS I use.  If it really had a poor security history, I would probably be spending time worrying about it, or contributing on an alternative DNS server project, as I did back when BIND <i>did</i> have a poor security record.<p>What security implications do you consider using BIND to have currently?",1256162939
