Rk,Team,Record,LW,BCS,AP,Analysis
1,Alabama,10-0 (7-0),1.0,1.0,1,"It was a close call for the top ranked Tide, but they eventually outlasted Mississippi State by a final of 20-7. Bama is somehow allowed to play Chattanooga this weekend, before an Iron Bowl for the ages – winner goes to the SEC Title game."
2,Florida State,10-0 (8-0),2.0,2.0,2,"Despite the controversy surrounding the Noles’ this week, they went out and pounded Syracuse 59-3. Their ACC schedule is officially wrapped up, they close the season with Idaho and Florida."
3,Ohio State,10-0 (6-0),3.0,3.0,4,"Ohio State improved to 10-0 on the season, with a 60-35 win over Illinois. The Buckeyes welcome Indiana to Columbus this weekend, before traveling to Ann Arbor to close out with Michigan"
4,Baylor,9-0 (6-0),4.0,4.0,3,"Baylor jumped up to #3 in the AP Poll, but remained #4 in the BCS following their 63-34 win over Texas Tech. Tests still remain for this team, though, with Oklahoma State, TCU and Texas left on the schedule."
5,Oregon,9-1 (6-1),6.0,5.0,5,"Funny how things can change in a week. Oregon, after beating Utah 44-21, is once again in the Pac-12 North driver seat after a Stanford loss. The Ducks should be able to navigate through Arizona and Oregon State – but Mariota’s health has to remain a concern. For the 2nd straight week, he totaled negative rushing yards."
6,Clemson,9-1 (6-1),7.0,7.0,7,"Clemson played on Thursday, easily beating Georgia Tech 55-31 at home. In true southern football fashion, the Tigers play The Citadel this weekend… Before closing with South Carolina on the road, a game that will have BCS implications."
7,Auburn,10-1 (6-1),8.0,6.0,6,"What. A. Finish. No doubt, the end to the Auburn vs Georgia game will be shown on highlight reels for years to come. The implications were huge, as now Auburn can win the SEC West with an Iron Bowl win over Alabama, in two weeks."
8,Oklahoma St.,9-1 (6-1),10.0,10.0,11,"Oklahoma State went through some growing plays in the middle part of the season, but the Cowboys are clicking on all cylinders now. They handed Mack Brown his worst home loss during his tenure at Texas, with a 38-13 win. Now – a primetime test we’ve been waiting for, Vs Baylor Saturday night."
9,Missouri,9-1 (5-1),11.0,8.0,8,"Missouri had the weekend off, benefiting on the polls because of it. The Tigers remain the top team in the SEC East, but have to get through Ole Miss and South Carolina to get there."
10,Stanford,8-2 (6-2),5.0,9.0,10,"Stanford went from Pac-12 North front runner, to potentially the Alamo Bowl with a 20-17 loss Saturday night to USC. The game showed if you have the size and strength, Stanford is a beatable team. The Cardinal close with Cal and Notre Dame."
11,Texas A&M,8-2 (5-2),9.0,12.0,9,"Texas A&M had a bye this weekend, but two HUGE games remain: at LSU this weekend, then at home versus Missouri."
12,Michigan St.,9-1 (6-0),13.0,13.0,13,"Michigan State clinched their spot in the Big 10 title game, with a clutch 41-28 win over Nebraska in Lincoln this weekend. The Spartans close with Northwestern and Minnesota."
13,USC,8-3 (5-2),,23.0,23,"Talk about a turnaround… This USC lost 10-7 to Washington State in LA, let that sink in. Saturday night, the Trojans defeated #5 Stanford 20-17 on a last second field goal. Ed Orgeron might not get the SC job next season, but he’ll get a job somewhere else after what he’s done for this program. USC still has an outside shot at the Pac-12 title game, they’ll have to beat Colorado and UCLA to stay alive though."
14,South Carolina,8-2 (6-2),12.0,11.0,12,"It was a clunker, but South Carolina found a way to beat Florida 19-14 Saturday. The Gamecocks still have a chance at the SEC Title, their conference schedule is done, but they need a Missouri loss. Spurrior takes on Coastal Carolina and Clemson to close the season."
15,UCLA,8-2 (5-2),18.0,14.0,14,"UCLA played Friday, and beat Washington 41-31 in LA. The Bruins still control their own destiny in the Pac-12 South, with two must-watch games remaining – Vs Arizona State and at USC."
16,Arizona State,8-2 (6-1),20.0,17.0,19,"Arizona State won with their defense Saturday, opposed to the normal formula of outscoring their opponent – beating Oregon State 30-17 and forcing 4 interceptions. The Sun Devils remain in the drivers’ seat to make the Pac-12 Title game, but they have to beat UCLA on the road this weekend."
17,LSU,7-3 (3-3),15.0,22.0,18,"LSU had the weekend off, and they needed it to prepare defensively to stop Texas A&M and Johnny Manziel. The Tigers were one of the few defenses to figure out the Heisman winner last year, but a win this year would likely keep Manziel from winning the award back-to-back years."
18,Oklahoma,8-2 (5-2),17.0,20.0,22,"Oklahoma bounced back from an embarrassing loss to Baylor, pounding Iowa State 48-10 in Norman. Kansas State and Oklahoma State remain on the schedule for the Sooners."
19,Wisconsin,8-2 (6-1),19.0,19.0,16,"Wisconsin continued to play tremendous football, beating Indiana 51-3 in Madison this weekend. The Badgers close with Minnesota and Penn State."
20,UCF,9-1 (6-0),14.0,18.0,17,"Central Florida barely beat Temple Saturday, paying the price in the polls. The Scarlet Knights still have a strong case for a BCS game, remaining atop the AAC, with their only loss coming to South Carolina."
21,Louisville,9-1 (5-1),16.0,21.0,21,"Much like their AAC counterpart UCF, Louisville barely beat Houston 20-13 Saturday. Not much more to say about this garbage conference."
22,Duke,8-2 (4-2),,,25,"How about them Duke Blue Devils! After a 48-30 win over Miami, Duke now controls their destiny in the ACC Coastal Division. That is not a misprint. They close with Wake Forrest and North Carolina."
23,Ole Miss,7-3 (3-3),,24.0,24,"Ole Miss found their way back into the Dirty Poll, with a 51-21 win over Troy. Strong showing this season, by the team who took home the nation’s #1 recruiting class."
24,Northern Ill.,10-0 (6-0),24.0,16.0,20,"Northern Illinois defeated Ball State, 48-27 Thursday night to remain undefeated."
25,Fresno State,9-0 (6-0),25.0,15.0,15,"Fresno State had a bye this weekend, the Bulldogs get New Mexico at home on Saturday."
