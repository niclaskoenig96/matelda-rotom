Consistent margins and spacing,Polishing,1.3.x,Bad example e.g. map theme selection in Preferences
Add missing activity icons,Polishing,1.3.x,"Routing, Tracking and Navigation still use generic icons"
QML Tile Creation Progress Item,Polishing,1.3.x,"QWidget version instantiated by MarbleMap, looks strange and is portrait only"
Improve whitespace usage in Search/Routing,Polishing,1.3.x,"Use more space for the map whenever possible (e.g. no search result, no turn directions)"
Remove via points,Feature,1.3.x,Currently deactivated as triggering it from the ViaPointEditor delegate affects the delegate itself (deletes it) which results in a segfault for some reason
More voice commands,Feature,1.3.x,"Announce destination, GPS loss. Test whether concatenated commands (turn distance) work."
Improve map matching,Feature,1.3.x,No turn instructions if direction and distance indicate that we're not following the route. Detect that a U-turn is needed and announce it.
Voice installation progress,Polish,1.3.x,Use a progress bar to show the voice navigation speaker download/installation progress.
Search result icons,Feature,1.3.x,Add an image provider for placemark icons and use it in search results
Reverse geocoding for via points,Feature,1.3.x,"Use that instead of ""Point in map"""
Jump to via point,Feature,1.3.x,Clicking on a via point in the via point editor should center on it
